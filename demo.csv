Registration
Abuja, Aug. 15, 2025 (NAN) Sokoto State Government says it had spent N4.7 billion to register students from the state for external examinations in the last two years.
The Commissioner for Basic and Secondary Education, Prof. Ahmed Ala, stated this during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja.
Ala told NAN that the exams included those conducted by West African Examinations Council (WAEC), National Examinations Council (NECO), Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) and National Board for Technical Education (NABTEB).
He said that the move was part of efforts by the state government to ensure that all students in the state who were eligible for the examinations sat for them, irrespective of the economic status of their parents and guardians.
The commissioner said that the state government also spends about N66 million on payment of imprests to secondary school principals to take care of their schools�?? immediate needs such as minor maintenance works.
According to him, under the arrangement, each of the principals receives N200,000 monthly from the state government as imprest.
He said that to motivate teachers in the state, government had increased their salaries from within the threshold of N20,000 to not less than N70,000, the national minimum wage.
�??Before the coming of the present administration, before a teacher gets his salary, it would be almost the end of the next month; government was always indebted as far as salary was concerned.
�??But today, by 19
th
, 20
th
, every teacher would have got his salary, except maybe delay is coming from his bank,�??�?? the commissioner told NAN.
According to him, the state government is determined to boost enrolment and retention in basic education.
To achieve this, he said that the ministry was sensitising parents and guardians on the need for them not only to enrol their wards but also to ensure that they remained in school until the end of their programmes. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

Safety
By Martha Agas
Abuja, Aug.15,2025(NAN) Female Journalists have urged media owners and managers to take primary responsibility for the safety of reporters in their employment particularly the females when they face threats and other attacks in the course of their work.
These threats they said include online abuse, sexist attacks and physical violence.
This is contained in a ?�communique issued at the end of a two-day workshop on the safety of female journalists in Abuja organised by the Media Rights Agenda (MRA).
The communiqu?? was made available to newsmen by MRA�??s Executive Director, Edetaen Ojo on Friday in Abuja.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that MRA with support from International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX) and Safety and Justice Grant held a workshop for 23 female journalists in Abuja from Aug. 12 to 13.
Ojo said the workshop was organised against the backdrop of an increasingly hostile environment for journalists, particularly female journalists who face unique, gender-specific threats and attacks.
The workshop`s sessions covered gendered and non-gendered attacks on female journalists, protection against physical and online threats, legal frameworks that protect female journalists and creating safer newsrooms for women in the media among other topics.
According to the communique, female journalists should be encouraged and trained to conduct regular threat assessments and environmental scans of locations where they intend to report from.
It stated that the training should include mentorship, knowledge exchange, and other peer learning methods aimed at guiding female journalist in developing clear strategies for responding to safety challenges in case of emergencies or escalating threats.
It said female journalists across the country should build a national protective network, cutting across media organisations and existing divides, through which they can demonstrate or strengthen solidarity and peer support.
�?? Female Journalists should undertake joint advocacy for the implementation of the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists in Nigeria and push for the adoption of any other national safety framework that may be necessary.
�?? Such a protective network may be anchored on the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ).
�??Media organisations should fulfil their obligations to support the safety and well-being of female journalists by providing necessary resources.
�??This is including appropriate transportation, safe accommodation, and financial support, especially when assignments require them to work late or cover high-risk events, �?? it stated.
According to the communique, participants reaffirmed their commitment to advancing their safety and protecting their rights as female journalists.
They called on the government, media organisations and associations, regulatory bodies, CSOs and international development partners among others to recognise that the safety of female journalists was central to media freedom, democracy, and national development. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

"Rescued miners narrate ordeal, seek unpaid wages recovery",Philomina Attah,8/15/2025 6:49,General News,"Wages
By Philomina Attah
Abuja, Aug. 15, 2025 ( NAN) Eleven Nigerian stranded miners in the Central African Republic (CAR), have expressed gratitude to the federal government for its swift intervention in their rescue.
Speaking on behalf of the returnees on Thursday in Abuja, Mr Freeborn Igorigo expressed.gratitude to President Bola Tinubu for their timely rescue, warm and dignified reception given to them.
The miners, who were allegedly lured to CAR by a Nigerian agent in collaboration with a Chinese national, had earlier made a public appeal for help through a viral video.
In the footage, the victims, visibly weak, distressed claimed they had been abandoned without pay for 11 months after being hired for mining work.
Sharing details of their months-long ordeal in the CAR forest, Igorigo said they endured life-threatening conditions, including threats from armed soldiers, physical assaults, imprisonment without cause, and prolonged deprivation.
�??Some of us have medical conditions from hazardous exposure and accidents in the forest.
�??We were threatened and beaten by soldiers and also imprisoned for nothing,�?� he said.
Igorigo, said he had worked for the company for three years and had been in CAR since September 2024.
He revealed that he was the individual who recorded and shared the video that alerted the public to their dire situation.
Describing the circumstances leading to his viral video, Igorigo said Chinese workers were evacuated from the site while Nigerian were left behind in dangerous, isolated conditions.
�??When we attempted to join the departing workers, we were met with armed threats and violence,�?� he said.
He expressed gratitude to the media, the public, and everyone who raised awareness of their plight.
According to him, the rescue was achieved through the coordinated efforts of Nigeria�??s ambassador to Central Africa, the office of the National Security Adviser, the Department of State Services (DSS), and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).
However, Igorigo lamented that after a year away from home, they were returning to their families empty-handed as their employers have withheld their salaries for nine months.
He said while the company occasionally provided small amounts as �??3D money�?� to placate workers, promises of full payment had turned out to be false.
Igorigo stressed that, now safe in Nigeria, their rescue is only �??the first step�?� and urged the government not to relent until justice is served and all their outstanding wages are paid
�??We are pleading with the authorities, the DSS, the Ministry of Mines, and the federal government to help us recover what we laboured for.
�??If such companies get away with this, it can encourage more exploitation of Nigerians abroad,�?� he said.
The News Agency of. Nigeria (NAN) recalls that following the viral video of the miners, there was a swift response from the Nigerian Embassy in CAR, in collaboration with the security forces.
The officials successfully located the miners and accompanied them on a multi-day journey from their remote location to the CAR capital city.
The returnees were on Thursday accompanied to Abuja by the Nigerian Ambassador to the CAR, Mr Babagana Ahmed.
The Asky Airlines Boeing 747-200 aircraft, with registration number ET-AXO, conveying the returnees touched down in Abuja at exactly 4:45 pm
They were received on arrival in Abuja, by a Federal Government delegation led by the Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Mrs Zubaida Umar.
Umar was represented at the y the Director of Search and Rescue, Air Commodore Kenneth Oyong.(NAN) (www.nannews.ng

Panel seeks comprehensive overhaul of Nigeria�??s non-custodial justice system
Justice
By Ibironke Ariyo
Abuja, Aug. 15, 2025 (NAN)The Independent Investigative Panel on Alleged Corruption, and Other Human Rights Violations in the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) has called for a comprehensive overhaul of Nigeria�??s non-custodial justice system,.
On the fourth day of a public hearing in Abuja, the panel examined the gaps in alternatives to imprisonment such as fines, compensation, community service, probation and parole.
Dr Uju Agomoh, the Secretary of the panel, in her summary of the day�??s proceedings in Abuja, said that the NCoS must improve the application of non-custodial measures to ease overcrowding in correctional centres.
She said that one critical issue was the plight of inmates given the option of fines or compensation but unable to pay.
The panel, she noted, had asked the NCoS to submit comprehensive data on inmates released through the intervention of the Minister of Interior, Dr Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo including the total amount spent and the number of beneficiaries.
According to records before the panel, in December 2023, the Minister of Interior secured the release of 4,086 inmates by raising N585 million.
This, she said were through private contributions to pay fines and compensation for low-risk offenders.
�??The panel commended the move but requested detailed breakdowns by custodial centres and states.
�??The panel also directed the Legal Aid Council of Nigeria to provide records of fines paid on behalf of inmates over the years.
�??The panel urge collaboration with stakeholders, including the Nigerian Bar Association�??s Section on Public Interest and Development Law (SPIDEL), to ensure efficient fine administration,�?�she said.
Agomoh, however, expressed concern that inmates often served months in custody for unpaid fines as low as N10,000 or N30,000, at a greater cost to the government.
She called for a comprehensive review of the fine system, alongside the establishment of a Victim Compensation Fund to address unresolved compensation payments preventing eligible inmates�?? release.
�??The panel also queried the implementation of Section 37(1) of the NCoS Act, 2019, which provides for non-custodial measures.
�??The panel has directed the NCoS to submit state-by-state statistics on community service, probation, parole and related interventions.
�??On funding, the panel questioned the lack of budgetary allocation for non-custodial services despite legal backing.
�??The panel has requested the NCoS to provide budget records from 2019 to date, including instances when such requests were denied or excluded,�?�she said.
Agomoh said that the panel had demanded updated staffing records for the Non-Custodial Directorate.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the NCoS disclosed having 1,563 officers in the directorate, disparities were noted, such as Kebbi State with 131 officers and Imo State with only seven.
The Panel further called for detailed deployment data across the 774 local government areas and recruitment plans.
�??In addition, the NCoS was asked to submit its strategic plan on facilities, training, operational manuals and resource allocation.
�??The panel acknowledged the role of academic partnerships, such as social science interns engaged in Anambra State, but stressed the need for proper training and oversight.
International and local Civil Society Groups, including UNICEF, United Action Against Corruption and Injustice International, and Prison Fellowship, were recognised for their submissions and recommendations, which the panel promised to review.
In her closing remark, Dr. Magdalene Ajani, Chairperson of the Panel and Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Interior, thanked all stakeholders, the media, and Nigerians following the proceedings online.
Ajani announced that a closed-door session would be held on Friday, Aug. 15, by invitation only, and urged stakeholders to submit any final documents beforehand.
�??I want to especially thank every institution present, the media for live coverage, and Nigerians watching online. If there is more information to share, please send it to the Secretariat.
�??As investigation continues, the Panel reiterated that non-custodial measures remain a vital but underutilised means of easing congestion in correctional centres and promoting a more humane justice system,�?�she maintained.(NAN) (www.nannews.ng)

HBBA decries increasing jailbreaks, seeks urgent prison reforms
Jailbreaks
By Ibironke Ariyo
Abuja, Aug. 15, 2025 (NAN) A Nigeria-based?�human rights organisation,?�Hope Behind Bars Africa has expressed deep concern over the jailbreak at the Medium Security Custodial Centre, Keffi (new), which occurred in the early hours of Tuesday, Aug. 12.
In a statement signed in Abuja by its Communications Lead, Mr. Obinna Ejiogu, the organisation described the incident as part of a troubling pattern of jailbreaks across the country�??s correctional facilities.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that at least 16 detainees escaped during the incident, while five staff members were injured, with two currently receiving urgent medical care.
Ejiogu recalled that in May 2025, seven detainees escaped from the Ilesha Custodial Centre in Osun State, while in March, 12 persons broke out of the Koton Karfe Correctional Centre in Kogi State.
According to him, the increasing frequency of jailbreaks signals a crisis in Nigeria�??s justice and corrections system, requiring urgent and holistic reforms.
�??There is a need for significant investment in infrastructure to modernise dilapidated facilities, measures to reduce overcrowding and policies to address systemic weaknesses.
�??I urge the Federal Government to take decisive steps to stop the current spate of jailbreaks,�?� Ejiogu said.
He also called on the National Assembly to prioritise correctional reform by passing legislation focused on strengthening and upgrading facilities.
He added that reducing the prison population through reforms in sentencing and alternatives to incarceration were critical to addressing the root causes of insecurity in custodial centres.
�??The time for urgent, coordinated action on the state of corrections in Nigeria is now,�?� Ejiogu said.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

New York, Aug. 15, 2025 (NAN) Conflict-related sexual violence continues to be used as a weapon of war, the annual Report of the Secretary-General on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, has shown.
The report stated that sexual violence in conflict zones rose sharply in 2024, increasing by a quarter compared to the previous year.
According to the report, more than 4,600 survivors endured abuses used as weapons of war, torture, terrorism and political repression.
The report showed that both State and non-State actors were responsible for violations in 21 countries.
The highest numbers of sexual violence were recorded in the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Haiti, Somalia and South Sudan.
Women and girls made up 92 per cent of victims, but men, boys, people with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities, racial and ethnic minorities, together with some persons with disabilities, were also targeted, ranging in age from one to 75.
�??These alarming figures do not reflect the global scale and prevalence of these crimes,�?� the?�Office of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict?�said.
Many attacks were accompanied by extreme physical violence, including summary executions, while stigma and harmful social reactions has often driven survivors and children born of wartime rape into deep social and economic marginalisation.
The report pointed to a troubling rise in sexual violence in detention, often used as a tool for torture, humiliation and the extraction of information.
While men and boys were most affected, women and girls were also targeted.
Non-State armed groups carried out such crimes to tighten control over territory and resources, and to impose extremist ideologies. Widespread availability of small arms, mass displacement and food insecurity were cited as factors that further increased the risks.
Pramila Patten, the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, regretted that parties to conflict frequently blocked or restricted humanitarian access for survivors.
�??The unprecedented severity and scale of destruction of healthcare facilities, and attacks, harassment and threats against frontline service providers, has severely hampered access to life-saving assistance for survivors,�?� Patten said.
The report listed?�63 State and non-State actors credibly suspected of or being responsible for patterns of sexual violence in armed conflicts?�on the?�Security Council�??s agenda.
While compliance with international humanitarian law remained low, several parties have made formal commitments to address crimes.
The report recommended involving Security Council sanctions committees to target persistent perpetrators, noting that sexual and gender-based violence is now explicitly sanctionable under the Council�??s counter-terrorism regime against Da�??esh and Al-Qaida.
The report urged all parties to adopt clear orders prohibiting sexual violence, ensure accountability and grant unimpeded UN access for monitoring and service provision.
�??The promise expressed by the Security Council through its six dedicated resolutions on conflict-related sexual violence is prevention,�?� Ms. Patten said.
�??We owe survivors more than solidarity; we owe them a life of dignity, and effective and decisive action to prevent and eradicate these crimes.�?�
Hamas was listed on the basis of information verified by the UN in 2024, indicating reasonable grounds to believe that some hostages taken to Gaza were subjected to different forms of sexual violence during their time in captivity.
The report noted clear and convincing information that sexual violence also occurred during the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023 in at least six locations.
For the first time, the report also named Israeli armed and security forces, and Russian forces and affiliates, parties �??on notice�?� for potential listing in the next annual report.
Due to �??significant concerns�?� regarding patterns of sexual violence perpetrated by �??these parties have been put on notice for potential listing in the next reporting period.�?� (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

Idris urges entrepreneurs to tap Tinubu�??s N200bn funds,alex enebeli,8/14/2025 23:56,General News,"Funds
By Alex Enebeli
Enugu, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alh. Mohammed Idris, has urged Nigerian entrepreneurs to utilise President Bola Tinubu�??s N200 billion business funds to grow their enterprises.
Idris made the call during a town hall meeting with stakeholders in Enugu on Thursday.
He said the Tinubu administration had created three key business funds totalling over N200 billion for Nigerian businesses to access.
The funds include the Presidential Conditional Grant Scheme, the Federal Government MSMEs Intervention Fund, and the Federal Government Manufacturing Sector Fund.
According to him, these funds are available nationwide and accessible to manufacturers and start-up businesses.
�??Only two days ago, Vice-President Kashim Shettima visited Calabar to inaugurate MSMEs clinics. I call on all entrepreneurs to embrace the Nigeria First Policy.
�??The President knows Nigerians are very creative, hence contractors, suppliers, and manufacturers in Nigeria will be considered first before any foreign counterparts.
�??The wealth of Nigeria belongs to Nigerians first. Only when competencies are unavailable locally will the President approve sourcing abroad,�?� Idris said.
He added that all ministries, departments, and agencies must patronise Nigerian goods and services before foreign ones.
�??This is the President�??s Nigeria First Policy,�?� Idris stressed.
He expressed delight that Enugu and Imo are among 11 states granted regulatory autonomy to oversee their electricity markets, from generation to distribution.
This, he said, followed Tinubu�??s unbundling of electricity, enabling states to generate and distribute their own power.
�??We expect other states to adopt this policy soon,�?� he added.
The minister noted economic stability was returning, with falling food prices and improved forex markets, as global rating agencies remain optimistic about Nigeria�??s $1 trillion economic target.
On youth development, Idris said Tinubu�??s administration had given unprecedented leadership opportunities to young Nigerians in ministries and agencies.
He revealed that over 400,000 students had accessed loans through the Nigerian Education Loan Fund.
�??Our President insists no child with the required credentials will be denied education due to inability to pay school fees.
�??He is paying their fees and providing pocket money to keep them in school,�?� he said.
Idris further disclosed that nearly 90,000 Nigerians had benefited from the administration�??s consumer credit scheme to purchase household appliances such as refrigerators and television sets.
�??They can access the consumer credit scheme and repay over time,�?� he explained. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)

Nigeria rescues 11 stranded miners from CAR,Philomina Attah,8/14/2025 23:28,Metro,"Miners
By Philomina Attah
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), in partnership with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Nigeria�??s embassy in Bangui, has evacuated 11 stranded Nigerian miners from the Central African Republic (CAR).
The miners were abandoned by their employer in the remote town of Bambari, after a distress video pleading for help went viral on social media.
A Sky Airlines Boeing 747-200 aircraft, registration number ET-AXO, conveying the returnees landed in Abuja at exactly 4:45 p.m. on Thursday.
From the international wing, they were moved to the Hajj Terminal for formal reception, immigration clearance, and screening by relevant security agencies.
In the viral video, the miners alleged abandonment and maltreatment by a Chinese mining company that recruited them for work in the French-speaking African nation.
The footage showed six men appealing to Nigerians to help spread their message and draw the Federal Government�??s attention to their plight.
Their location was later identified as Senye, a village in the Bambari region of CAR.
They were accompanied to Nigeria by the Nigerian Ambassador to CAR, Mr Babagana Ahmed.
Welcoming them at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, NEMA Director-General, Mrs Zubaida Umar, commended the swift inter-agency response to the miners�?? distress call.
Represented by Air Commodore Kenneth Oyong, Director of Search and Rescue, she said security agencies, including the Office of the National Security Adviser and the National Intelligence Agency, played key roles.
She noted the miners, who endured months of hardship without pay, were first relocated to the Nigerian ambassador�??s residence in Bangui, where they received care before arrangements for return.
On arrival in Nigeria, the miners were given meals, overnight accommodation, and money to assist in reconnecting with their families.
She reaffirmed the Federal Government�??s commitment to protecting Nigerians abroad, in line with President Bola Tinubu�??s vision for prompt attention to citizens in distress overseas.
Ambassador Ahmed confirmed the successful rescue and evacuation of 11 Nigerians stranded for eight months in a remote forest village under the Bambari region, 850 kilometres from Bangui.
He recalled a viral video of July 24, 2025, in which the stranded Nigerians pleaded for urgent evacuation from Senye village.
They had been recruited to work at mining sites but were later abandoned by their employer in the isolated forest area.
Following swift intervention by the Nigerian Embassy, relevant CAR authorities, and the employer, the nationals were rescued and evacuated to Bangui on July 28.
Since then, the embassy has provided them with accommodation, food, medical care, and other essential welfare support.
The mission thanked the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Office of the National Security Adviser, NEMA, embassy staff, and all stakeholders for their commitment to the evacuation process.
�??This rescue demonstrates the power of timely intervention and collaboration to safeguard Nigerians in distress,�?� Ahmed said.
One of the repatriated miners, Oluremi Peters, recounted being stranded in CAR with colleagues.
Peters said they were invited to CAR by a Nigerian associate and a Chinese national, who promised lucrative mining work.
He said they arrived in September 2024 but were left idle for four months, with assurances that equipment would arrive soon.
During this period, they were arrested by CAR police, suspected of printing money or being bandits, and detained for 16 days.
After release, they worked on a road project and later at a mining site, facing payment disputes with the employer.
�??We were promised 450,000 CFA francs monthly, but received only 300,000 CFA for the first month and partial pay for the second,�?� he said.
Frustrated, they made a video appeal to the Nigerian government, which he believes prompted swift intervention and repatriation.
Peters thanked the Nigerian government and the CAR embassy for their support.
He advised young Nigerians to research thoroughly and secure concrete offers before accepting overseas work.
The miners�?? safe repatriation reflects the administration�??s resolve to protect its citizens wherever they are.
Peters said the government�??s swift action was commended as proof of its commitment to citizens�?? safety and welfare abroad. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)

Loan
By Ijendu Iheaka
Umuahia. Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) Abia Government has announced the approval of $125 million Islamic Bank (IsDB) Loan financing facility by the Federal Executive Council at its meeting of Wednesday, Aug. 13.
Mr Ukoha Njoku, the Chief Press Secretary to Gov. Alex Otti, disclosed this in a statement issued to newsmen in Umuahia on Thursday.
Ukoha added that the facility would be used for the state Integrated Infrastructure Development Project.
�??This approval marks a major milestone in a project that has undergone extensive consultations and procedural steps.
�??The fund is a critical component of the overall co-financing arrangement for the state�??s ambitious infrastructure development drive.
�??The project�??s total cost is $263.80 million,�?� Ukoha stated.
He added that $100 million would be sourced from the African Development Bank (AfDB).
According to him, $15 million will be obtained from the Canada�??Africa Development Bank; while $23.80 million counterpart fund would come from the State Government.
Ukoha described the IsDB facility as particularly significant �??because its financing agreement must be signed for the project to proceed, given the integrated nature of the co-financing structure.
He stated: �??The AfDB and Canada�??Africa Development Bank financing agreements have already been concluded, with the AfDB loan agreement signed earlier this year.
�??Under the project, the IsDB financing will support the construction of approximately 126 kilometres of road network in Aba and 35.57 kilometres in Umuahia.�?�
He explained that the road projects would include a link road between the two cities, as well as critical erosion control works within the project sites.
He stated that when completed, the projects would reduce travel time in Abia�??s busiest urban corridors and create over 3,000 jobs for local residents.
He further added that the project would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve access to social services; and attract private sector investments.
Ukoha added that the project, owned by Abia Government, would be executed through the State Ministry of Works, under the supervision of the State Steering Committee.
He noted that the steering committee would provide policy direction for the State Project Implementation Unit and all the stakeholders in the project.
He further explained that the IsDB-financed components, covering civil works and consultancy services, would follow the bank�??s procurement guidelines, with disbursements made directly to contractors and consultants.
�?�This milestone follows sustained engagement and intergovernmental coordination.
�??This approval is also a direct complement to the visionary infrastructural development agenda of the administration,�?� he added.
Ukoha stated that since assuming office, Otti had made Abia road network�??s modernisation, revitalisation of urban centres, and integration of sustainable development principles a cornerstone of his administration.
�??The IsDB facility will strengthen these ongoing efforts, accelerating the pace of road reconstruction in Aba and Umuahia.
�??It will also address critical erosion challenges, and lay the groundwork for an integrated transportation network that supports commerce, improves quality of life, and enhances Abia�??s competitiveness,�?� he added.
Ukoha quoted Otti to have expressed appreciation to President Bola Tinubu for his trust and pragmatic leadership and the National Assembly for approving the borrowing plan.
He added that the governor also thanked the Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Mr Wale Edun, for his leadership in concluding the financing process.
The statement further quoted the governor as thanking the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Attorney General of the Federation, the Vice President IsDB, Dr Mansur Muhktar and all other stakeholders that contributed to making the request for the facility successful.
He also stated that Otti remarked that the project would complement his administration�??s ongoing infrastructural development initiatives.
�??He believed that such initiatives are aimed at modernising Abia�??s transportation network, revitalising urban centres, and positioning the state as a hub for sustainable economic growth,�?� the statement added. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

By Peter Uwumarogie
Akko (Gombe State), Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has tasked stakeholders in the transport sector to adhere to safety protocols to prevent road crashes involving tankers and trailers.
The Sector Commander, Mr Samson Kaura, stated this on Thursday during a town hall meeting organised by the Corps, at its headquarters in Lafiyawo community of Akko Local Government Area of the state.
The theme of the meeting is: �??Trailer/Tanker Crash Prevention and the Dangers of Fuel Scooping from Crash Scenes.�?�
Kaura said the engagement was carried out in line with Corps Marshal, Shehu Mohammed�??s mandate for FRSC across the country
The mandate was to brainstorm and identify practical steps to prevent road crashes, especially those involving heavy duty vehicles.
He said the engagement was to sensitise all stakeholders, including truck owners, leaders of truck drivers�?? associations, and other key players about the dangers of tanker crashes and safety protocols.
The commandant said that at the end of the engagement, stakeholders were expected to develop strategies to address the menace.
�??This initiative aims to prevent incidents like tanker crashes, fires and explosions, which can result in fatalities and significant property damage.
�??I urge all stakeholders to pass the safety messages to drivers, especially on the dangers of overloading and improper loading which are major causes of tanker crashes on our roads,�?� he said.
Kaura also cautioned residents against attempting to scoop fuel from crashed trucks loaded with petroleum products in case of crashes, saying �??your life is more important, so run away from such scenes.�?�
Mr Kallamu Usman, the Gombe Commissioner for Works, Housing, and Transportation, urged stakeholders in the transport sector to intensify awareness campaigns among fuel tanker drivers.

Lagos, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) Prof. Joy Odewunmi of Lagos State University of Education,?� on Thursday, called on parents to teach their children dialects?� to prevent extinction of indigenous languages.
Odewunmi also urged governments to invest more in teachers of indigenous languages.
She made the call during presentation of experiences in a research carried out on indigenous languages with the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) 2023 grant.
The event held at the Lagos State University of Education (LASUED), Ijaniki, Lagos State.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Odewunmi is of the College of Language and Communication Arts Education, LASUED.
The research was entitled �??Teaching Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba Proverbs Using Colouring Books and Interactive Animations for Nigerian Junior Primary Schools�??.
The professor said that parents should make speaking of?� native?� languages attractive to?� their children.
�??Parents should speak to their children in their native languages. I know the brain has the capacity to learn 10,000 languages.
�??Speak to them in your mother tongue and make the language attractive,�?� she said.
She said there was a gap in learning and proficiency in speaking Nigerian languages among the youth.
She noted that the 2022 National Policy on Education prescribed that mother tongues should be used as a medium of instruction for primary pupils.
�??For junior secondary schools, the three major Nigerian languages are prescribed for learning.
�??There is a continuous decline in use of our indigenous languages. There is now a renewed national pronouncement about adherence to teaching of primary pupils in their mother tongue,�?� she said.
Dr Ngozi Dom-Anyanwu appealed to the federal and state governments to produce more teachers on indigenous languages.
Dom-Anyanwu is a lecturer at the Department of Nigerian Languages, Igbo Unit, LASUED.
�??Some teachers of?� these languages are not qualified. They are not qualified in teaching these languages. Some of them are ill-trained.
�??When I say that they are ill-trained, what I mean is this: you go to a secondary school and see people teaching Igbo Language but they did not study Igbo Language in any higher institution.
The don said that a major challenge encountered during the research was that some states had?� different dialects.
�??Maybe, they studied history or any other course, but because they are of Igbo origin, they just choose to teach the language.
�??We should have qualified teachers, and those who are ill-trained should be given on-the-job training so that they will be able to teach well,�?� she said.
She also said that governments should provide instructional materials.
Prof. Oladayo Akomu of the Department of Nigerian Languages, LASUED, said that researches must be beneficial to?� the society.
�??We won a grant from TETFUND and carried out a research, and today is the grand finale where we have to present our experience on the field.
�??Over the years, Lagos State Government has tried when it comes to the issue of promoting indigenous languages.
�??For instance, all Lagos State tertiary institutions are now offering Yoruba at the level of general studies; so, we have to praise the government for that.
He urged the government to work on the outcomes of the research.
�??The usual practice in the past was that when we had research of this nature, the stakeholders didn�??t always work on the outcomes.
�??We appeal to the government to look into our recommendation.
�??There are lots of research that we can carry out on indigenous languages apart from the one we have just done; so government has a lot of roles to play,�?� he said. (NAN)

Sani inaugurates construction of Karatudu-Romi road abandoned for 13 years,Hussaina Yakubu,8/14/2025 21:49,General News,"Sani inaugurates construction of Karatudu-Romi road abandoned for 13 years
Groundbreaking
By Hussaina Yakubu
Kaduna, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) Gov. Uba Sani of Kaduna State has inaugurated the construction of the Karatudu-Romi road in Chikun Local Government Area, 13 years after the project was abandoned.
Performing the groundbreaking ceremony on Thursday in Kaduna, Sani said the road was initially awarded during the administration of the late Gov. Patrick Yakowa but was stalled after his death.
The Governor described the project as a critical infrastructure that would benefit the people of Karatudu and Unguwan Romi communities.
�??Our administration is prioritising rural development and focusing on areas where the less privileged reside,�?� Sani said.
He assured that the road would be completed within eight months, stating that a reputable contractor had been engaged and would mobilise to site immediately.
�??Our government keeps to its promises. We do not play politics of deceit. We focus on verifiable, impactful projects,�?� he said.
Sani disclosed that his administration had so far awarded over 83 road contracts across the state, with 31 already completed.
He criticised some politicians for abandoning the area in the past, saying they were now returning to seek political relevance without delivering meaningful projects.
The governor explained that the Karatudu-Romi project would include several adjoining township roads, such as Cemetery Road, Lusawa Road, School Road to Karatudu, and Jemaa Road.
He added that another ongoing road project from Keke to Makera, and Doka Mai Jemaa to Dan Hono in Kujama Ward, was also being executed in Chikun LGA.
Sani said the Water Intake Road from Unguwan Mai Gero to Narayi had been completed and inauguratesd.
He further disclosed that construction would soon commence on the road linking Zenith Bank Roundabout on Kachia Road to the Flour Mill area, connecting Chikun and Kaduna South LGAs.
The governor also revealed that funds had been released for the construction of the long-abandoned Television-Kaduna Garage-Sabon Tasha Road, which links four electoral wards.
According to Sani, the project is expected to commence next week.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

Faleye wants NSITF operations digitalised,Joan Nwagwu,8/14/2025 21:47,Metro,"Digitalisation
By Joan Nwagwu
Abuja, Aug.14, 2025 (NAN) Mr Oluwaseun Faleye, Managing Director of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF ) has called for urgent need for the digital transformation of its operations.
Faleye said this during a two-day Bi-Annual Regional Management Performance Review (RMPR) in Abuja on?� Thursday.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the meeting, which was holding simultaneously in the six regions of the NSITF across the nation, had its theme �??Beyond Targets: Delivery Excellence and Sustainable growth�?�
Faleye said that it was optional, rather it was imperative for the Fund operations to be digitally transformed.
According to him, digital transformation is not optional, it is urgent. We are investing in e-NSITF platforms, digital records systems, and data-driven service delivery to reduce manual inefficiencies, improve transparency, and restore confidence.
�??So, the exercise is not merely to audit numbers, but to reaffirm our shared mission of transferring the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund into an institution that delivers tangible, people-centred impact at scale.
�??We are navigating a complex landscape, where expectations are rising, technology is distrusting old models, and our relevance is being measured by not just what we do, but how we do it.
�??We must ask more of ourselves, we must move beyond the comfort of �??meeting targets�?? and embrace the new standard delivery excellence.
�??Excellence that is visible in how we treat contributions, in how swiftly we process claims, in how compassionately we engage beneficiaries, and in how clearly our value is felt by workers, employers and society.�?�
He charged the review team to be honest, courageous, and solution-oriented, while urging them to �??highlight what is working, spotlight what is not, share ideas that can travel across regions, and raise red flags before they become crises.�?�
Also, Mrs Mojisola Macaulay, Executive Director,?� Operations in NSITF, said the review afforded the opportunity to reflect on progress, confront challenges, and recommit to operational excellence.
In his speech, Mr Samaila Abdul, Executive Director, Administration, said the Fund remains committed to supporting the staff to achieve the organisation�??s goals.
He urged them to redouble their efforts in preaching Employees Compensation Scheme (ECS)and in contribution collections.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

Bye-election: Zamfara APC raises alarm over deployment of outlawed security outfit,Ishaq Zaki,8/14/2025 21:37,Politics,"Bye-election: Zamfara APC raises alarm over deployment of outlawed security outfit
Bye-election
By Ishaq Zaki
Gusau, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Zamfara chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has cautioned against the deployment of outlawed security volunteers popularity known as �??Yansakai�?? to Kaura Namoda Local Government Area ahead of Saturday�??s State House of Assembly bye-election in the state.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has scheduled Saturday to conduct bye-election for Kaura Namoda South State House of Assembly Constituency.
The scheduled bye-election followed the demise of the lawmaker representing the constituency, Aminu Kasuwar-Daji of the APC.
In a statement issued in Gusau on Thursday, the state APC Publicity Secretary, Malam Yusuf Idris said the party has concluded all the required arrangements to participate fully in the Saturday�??s bye-election in a peaceful manner.
Idris, however, alleged that there were plans for the engagement of illegal security outfits in the election process by some desperate politicians.
�??We have noticed the movement of some suspected miscreants in the state for them to participate in the forthcoming bye-election for Kaura Namoda South state assembly constituency.
�??Based on the information we gathered, the suspected miscreants are being kitted with uniforms and firearms to participate in the election process, which is totally against the electoral laws,�?� Idris said.
Idris accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state for using state government machineries to win the election.
�??This is an alarming situation used by the PDP in their desperate move to forcefully ensure that their candidate is declared winner at the end of the election no matter who gets wounded or killed.
�??The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is certainly not happy with the strength of the APC in the areas that the poll will be conducted.
�??That is why they resolved to use miscreants to achieve their selfish political interests.
�??We fear for the lives and properties?� of our electorate and those of our party members.
�??APC is a peace loving party, we want to use this medium to alert the security agencies in the state in good time, for them to take proactive measures,�?� Idris added.
The party urged the authorities to make sure that only the reputable security agencies especially the Police, DSS and the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were involved in the election process.
Reacting to the allegations, the State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Alhaji Halliru Andi, described them as baseless and a propaganda by the APC over the fear of participating the election.
Andi said that the PDP in the state had no record of election malpractices or creating violence during elections.
He accused the APC for using unnecessary statements, saying, �??this is because of its desperation to win the bye-election.
�??Every one knows that in the history of?� Zamfara, the PDP chapter has been a peace loving umbrella.
�??The APC Zamfara chapter is used to create unnecessary allegations to divert the attention of the authorities and the public
�??Therefore, all the allegations by the APC against the PDP are not true.
�??I am therefore calling on the public and the authorities to disregard such allegations as they are created to create havoc in the state ahead of election day,�?�?� he added.(NAN)(

ASUP issues 21 days ultimatum to FG over lingering demands,Joan Nwagwu,8/14/2025 21:30,Metro,"Demands
By Joan Nwagwu
Abuja, Aug. 14. 2025(NAN) The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) has issued a 21-day ultimatum to the Federal Government to meet its outstanding demands in an agreement entered with the union.
Mr Shammah Kpanja, President of ASUP, said this while addressing newsmen at the end of an emergency meeting of the National Executive Council of the union on Thursday in Abuja.
Kapanja said that the demands by the union includes the non release of a circular to effect the payment of its Peculiar Academic Allowance by the National Salaries Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC).
He said the Peculiar Academic Allowances paid to academic staff across Polytechnics was a component of the ASUP/FGN 2010 agreement.
The union leader said, rather than make provisions for payment, the allowances have been removed from the budgeting template and the Federal Ministry of Education (FME) had failed to intervene in definite terms on the subject.
He said the NEC expressed deep concerns over the continued decision by the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) to outsource the accreditation process for polytechnics in the country despite assurances to desist from such actions.
The union leader said the 25/35 per cent arrears of salary review was yet to be implemented.
He said that the arrears which cover a 12-month period and captured in the budget was yet to be released for reasons beyond the comprehension of the union.
ASUP president added that NEC?� expressed deep concerns over the continued decision by the NBTE to outsource the accreditation process for polytechnics in the country despite assurances to desist from such actions.
He said that most states government have failed to implement the New National Minimum Wage.
He said NEC have expressed worry over the continued delay and non approval of a dual mandate structure aimed at eliminating the agelong discrimination against HND holders.
�??In view of the items listed above our union�??s NEC has resolved to issue a 21 days ultimatum to the Government to address the issues satisfactorily.
�??A failure to utilise this window may lead to the declaration of a trade dispute and withdrawal of services of our members across public polytechnics and monotechnics nationwide�?� he said.(NAN) (www.nannews.ng)

She commended ICPC for its professionalism, empathy in pursuing justice, and physical support during court proceedings.
�??We value ICPC�??s track record in addressing high-profile cases and the compassion it has shown.
�?�But more must be done to ensure dignity, protection, and fairness for persons with disabilities,�?� she said.
She called for the creation of a Department of Veteran Affairs in Nigeria to address the welfare of law enforcement officers and persons with disabilities.
According to her, this should
include timely salary payments, healthcare access, and adequate protection to reduce insecurity and social unrest.
Her proposals also included: appointment of a dedicated desk officer for disability matters, specialised training programmes, audits of donor funds for disability-focused projects, as well as the inclusive and accessible policymaking dialogues.
The association presented a formal petition and proposed a Memorandum of Understanding to formalise collaboration with ICPC.

"By-elections: INEC urges political parties, candidates, others to adhere to law",Oloniruha Emmanuel,8/14/2025 21:19,Politics,"By-elections
By Emmanuel Oloniruha
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has appealed to political parties, candidates and all stakeholders participating in the Saturday by-election to adhere strictly to the provisions of the law, regulations and guidelines.
INEC, in a statement by the National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Sam Olumekun, on Thursday in Abuja, said that doing so would ensure seamless processes.
Olumekun said that the commission, at its regular weekly meeting on Thursday, discussed about its final presentation for the by-election, among other matters.
He said that the commission also discussed about the resumption of continuous voter registration (CVR) and the publication of the personal particulars of candidates for the Feb. 21, 2026 area council elections in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
Olumekun disclosed that all non-sensitive materials for the by-elections had been delivered to the affected states, while election technology, such as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), had been configured for the exercise.
�??The recruitment and training of ad hoc staff as well as security and logistics arrangements have been concluded. The final consignment of sensitive materials will be delivered today as scheduled.
�??The commission wishes to remind political parties and candidates that campaigns end at midnight today, Thursday, Aug. 14.
�??With less than 48 hours to the opening of polls, the commission reiterates its appeal to all those involved in the by-elections as political parties, candidates, voters, party agents, observers and the media to adhere strictly to the provisions of the law, regulations and guidelines.
�??Doing so will ensure seamless processes,�?� he said.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the by-elections, schedule for Saturday, will be held in 16 constituencies across 12 states of the federation.
The by-elections involve two senatorial districts in Anambra and Edo states, five federal constituencies in Edo, Jigawa, Kaduna, Ogun and Oyo states, and nine state constituencies in Adamawa, Anambra, Kaduna (2), Kano, Kogi, Niger, Taraba and Zamfara states.
NAN also reports that the by-elections were occasioned by the resignation or death of serving members of the national and state assemblies.
On the resumption of CVR, Olumekun reminded Nigerians that the exercise would resume on Aug. 18 nationwide with the online pre-registration of voters.
He added that the physical or in-person registration would follow on Aug. 25 at all the 811 INEC state and local government offices across the country.
Olumekin said that the list and locations of the centres, including dedicated telephone numbers for citizens in need of assistance, could be obtained from INEC website and other online platforms.
According to him, the active CVR locator will go live on Aug. 17.
�??During the CVR, citizens will also have the opportunity to transfer their registration within a state or to other states of the federation. Similarly, damaged or lost PVCs will be replaced as provided by law.
�??It needs to be re-emphasied that the CVR is only open to Nigerian citizens who are 18 years or older, and who have not registered before, as double or multiple registration is a punishable offence under the law,�?� he said.
On the FCT area council elections, Olumekun stated that 17 political parties had uploaded their candidates�?? nomination forms as at 6 p.m. of Aug. 11 when the dedicated portal automatically shut down.
He said that in line with the provisions of Section 29(3) of the Electoral Act, 2022, the commission would, on Aug. 18, publish the personal particulars of the candidates by displaying copies of their Form EC9.
The publication, he said, would be done along with all the accompanying academic credentials and other documents submitted by the candidates in all INEC offices in the six area councils of the FCT.
�??The 17 parties participating in the election nominated 637 candidates for the 68 seats (six chairmen and 62 councillors) in the FCT,�?� he said.
Olumekun appealed to Nigerians to scrutinise the documents.
�??Any aspirant who participated in his/her party primaries with reasonable grounds to believe that the information provided by a candidate is false can challenge the nomination in a Federal High Court as provided in Section 29(5) of the Electoral Act, 2022.
�??The final list of candidates will be published on 22nd September, 2025 which is at least 150 days before the day of the election,�?� he said.
This, he added, was in line with the provisions of Section 32(1) of the Electoral Act, 2022 and listed as item seven on INEC timetable and schedule of activities for the elections.
Olumekun pledged that INEC would continue to update Nigerians on all its activities. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

"Why we involve EFCC, others in recovering Anchor Borrowers loans �?? MAAN",Priscilla Osaje,8/14/2025 21:11,Agriculture,"Loans
By Priscilla Osaje
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Maize Association of Nigeria (MAAN) says it is working with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Department of State Services (DSS), and the Nigeria Police to recover Anchor Borrowers Programme loans from its members.
Its National President, Mr Bello Abubakar, said this at a news conference after a three-day meeting organised by the association in Abuja on Thursday.
The meeting includes association�??s state chairmen, zonal coordinators, national officers, and other stakeholders in the maize value chain such as researchers, input suppliers, farmers, and the end users.
The MAAN boss said the purpose of the press briefing was to inform the general public on the efforts being made in recovering the Anchor Borrowers Programme loan given to the association from 2018 to 2021 for maize production,�?� he said.
�??MAAN understands that the ABP/CBN programme is a revolving loan due for full recovery, depending on the participants (farmers) for compliance.
�??Unfortunately, there was a monumental disappointment as most of the participants/farmers thought that the loan was national cake,�?� Abubakar said.
He said due to the recalcitrant attitude of the participants/farmers towards repayment of the loan, MAAN was constrained to write several demand letters to the defaulters as well as seek synergy with the law enforcement and anti-graft agencies like EFCC, DSS, and the Nigeria Police for assistance in line with Federal Government policies of loan recovery.
�??It is most unfortunate that some of the participants/defaulters who tried to evade responsibility to both MAAN and the agencies in support of our loan recovery, took us to various courts for enforcement of their purported human rights which they claimed were violated.�?�
The MAAN president said the association took some of the defaulters to court for the recovery of the loan, and most of those cases are still pending in courts.�?�
He said insecurity is grossly affecting the association members, saying �??some of our farms and farmers were burnt, kidnapped, and killed by bandits on the farms in Niger, Zamfara, Katsina, Borno, Yobe, Sokoto, Ondo, and Ekiti states.
According to him, flooding has also affected the farmers in Kogi, Benue, Cross River, Jigawa, Katsina, Taraba, Niger, Kebbi, and Kwara states, with drought threatening their members in Oyo, Kwara, Niger, Ondo, Ekiti, and Benue states.
Abubakar urged the Federal Government to create an enabling environment that would give smallholder farmers the opportunity to settle their outstanding loans, produce for domestic needs and exports.
According to him, government should show compassion to farmers in consideration of the unmitigated and debilitating factors making productive farming and harvest impossible.
The MAAN boss appealed to the government to either waive or review downward the outstanding financial obligations of the association in the CBN/ABP programme.
He commended President Bola Tinubu�??s administration for its efforts in ensuring food security in the country.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

INEC assures credible Kano by-elections,Ramatu Garba,8/14/2025 20:59,General News,"INEC
By Ramatu Garba
Kano, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Kano State says it is fully prepared to conduct peaceful, credible, and transparent by-elections in parts of the state on Saturday, Aug. 16.
The State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Amb. Abdu Zango, disclosed this while briefing journalists in Kano on Thursday.
Zango said the State Assembly by-elections would take place in Bagwai/Shanono and Ghari (Kunchi)/Tsanyawa Local Government Areas.
He said non-sensitive materials were dispatched to the local governments three weeks ago, sorted according to registration areas and polling units, while sensitive materials had arrived for onward distribution.

He added that the Ghari supplementary poll collation would take place at INEC headquarters.

Nigeria economy growing  consistently due to ongoing reforms �?? Edun,Nana Musa,8/14/2025 20:50,Economy,"Growth
By Nana Hauwa Musa
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Mr Wale Edun, says the Nigerian economy is experiencing  consistent growth within the context of global developments and ongoing domestic reform programmes.
Edun said this at a news conference to provide update on the economy, in Abuja on Thursday.
He said that Nigeria�??s gross revenues increased by 37.4 per cent in the first half of 2025.
According to him, the medium-term goal is to achieve seven per cent in annual Gross Domestic Products (GDP) growth, driven by critical investments by government, private investment, job creation and higher incomes.
The minister  said  that to achieve this, Nigeria needed to invest in critical sectors and expand Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements across agriculture, educational, health, manufacturing, technology and infrastructure.
He said that since the first half of 2023, the combined fiscal balance of the states had grown from 1.8 per cent of GDP to 3.1 per cent.
�??That is from N2.8 trillion to over N7.1 trillion, which is a surplus.
�??That means that the states have been provided funding that have now allowed them to be in surplus, giving them greater capacity to invest.
�??It must be said that the increase in spending of the states has, in fact, mainly gone to capital expenditure, and that is the basis of the type of spending and growth that we are looking for,�?� he said
Edun said that in the oil and gas sector, the average production in the first half of 2025 was 1.67 million barrels per day, which was below the 2.06 million barrels budgeted.
He said that the average crude price was budgeted for at 75 dollar per barrel, adding that Nigeria now has an average price of 67 dollar per barrel.
�??We have maintained compliance with the OPEC quota, and as you can see from the figures I have given, there is a revenue shortfall, in response to that.
�??We have prioritised spending on sectors that directly impact citizens and support our growth ambitions,�?� he said.
In the power sector, the minister said there had not been national grid collapse in 2025.
He said that all approvals were in place to liquidate four trillion Naira legacy debts, and to implement a sustainable framework under the Electricity Act.
�??it is a combination of removing or repaying or refinancing the outstanding debt so that those who are owed can in turn pay out their own obligations, as well as looking for sustainability going forward.
�??There  is the mission 300 initiative of the World Bank and the African Development Bank, that supports providing electricity connectivity to 300 million additional Africans.
�??Nigeria is a key beneficiary, and this is unlocking investment in manufacturing, agro-processing and services, as a result of greater access to electricity,�?� he said.
The minister reiterated the Federal Government commitment to a coordinated fiscal and monetary policy framework that could substantially and sustainably reduce inflation.
He said that it would enable cheaper capital for businesses to invest, and greater purchasing power for households.
He said that President Bola Tinubu�??s led administration was commitment to transparency, consistent and data-driven communication.
�??We believe that this dialogue is essential to building public trust and informing our citizens about decisions that are being taken on their behalf.
�??We now have a very competitive exchange rate and other conditions, which are allowing us to diversify our exports, particularly under the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement.
�??Interest rates across major economies remain elevated as reflecting the fight against inflation,�?� he said.
Edun said that the country was open for business, stating that Nigeria has a stable macroeconomic conditions that can help people plan and invest.
�??We will continue to emphasise and open the doors to private investment across agriculture, manufacturing, technology, infrastructure and services.
�??At the same time, we are committed to maintaining discipline, not only to save wealth, but to invest wisely, focussing on education, health and infrastructure that drive long-term productivity and inclusive growth.
�??Our commitment is to build an economy that works for everyone, with transparency and resilience,�?� the minister said. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

Culture
By Fortune Abang
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) Nigeria�??s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Amb. Yusuf Tuggar, has underscored the need for investors to leverage Nigeria-Germany cultural ties to drive the country�??s growth.
Tuggar gave the advice while receiving the Salute Nigeria Initiative, organisers of the Nigeria-German Investment and Cultural Expo (NGICE), at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday in Abuja.
The minister, who had served as Ambassador of Nigeria to Germany for six years commended the NGICE concept, saying it could further strengthen Nigeria-Germany diplomatic relations.
According to him, when it comes to the issue of culture, Germany always has a listening voice, because in Germany the word culture goes beyond just culture.
Tuggar said, �??Germany is a country?�with rich cultural?�heritage.
�??There is a lot within that cultural space that requires investment and collaboration, because we are going through renaissance of Nigerian culture.
�??If you look at this generation of Nigerians, they listen almost exclusively to Nigerian music, especially Afrobeat.
�??Meanwhile, Nigerian food and fashion are gaining global recognition.
�??There is much in our culture that resonates with today�??s world, particularly as people pay more attention to what they consume, especially in terms of food.
�??When you talk about superfoods, lots of the things?�that we take for granted here are in high demand globally.
�??If it is not Moringa, it is ?�bamboo and we have some of the best ginger in the world as well. There is so much to take advantage of culturally.�?�
The minister advised that the Ministries of Culture and Tourism, as well as Industry, Trade and Investment should be equally contacted to bolster partnership in the NGICE.
�??Our mission in Berlin will be informed, so that they can provide necessary support, in terms of facilitating visas; such shouldn�??t be a problem for us to support.
�??Also, ensure you have the German Embassy here in Nigeria fully involved in the NGICE, because it would help to bring about good success,�?� he added.

Speaking at the event, Dr Mike Okiro, Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Salute Nigeria Initiative, said Berlin was chosen for the NGICE because of Germany�??s position as Europe�??s cultural hub.
Okiro, former Inspector-General of Police, said Tuggar�??s experience as Nigeria�??s ambassador to Germany would, in his role as Foreign Affairs Minister, attract more investors through NGICE and help Nigeria benefit from his time in Germany.
According to Okiro, Nigeria has a lot of things beyond crude oil and gas, which are not the only resources that we have in Nigeria.
�??We have so many things, which we can sell to the outside world, particularly culture.
�??Nigeria is going to benefit from this investment from the outside world, the more reason we are going to Germany, not only for culture, but also for attracting investment into the country,�?� he added.
Meanwhile, Amb. Chielo Ojirika, Director-General of the Salute Nigeria Initiative, said the aim of the event was to project Nigeria�??s image and culture, as well as attract foreign investments.
Ojirika, Coordinator of the NGICE, said the event was scheduled for Oct. 20 to 23,?� in Berlin.
He said it would showcase Nigeria�??s rich investment and cultural potential to attract foreign direct investment and boost business partnerships with Germany and other European countries.
�??The?�aim is to bring the world through Berlin to Nigeria, as an investors�?? paradise and to strengthen the existing bilateral and economic relations between the Nigeria and Germany.�?� he said. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)

"Anambra, WHO partner on Measles-Rubella vaccination campaign set for Feb 2026",Lucy Osuizigbo-Okechukwu,8/14/2025 20:27,Health,"Vaccination
By Lucy Osuizigbo-Okechukwu
Awka, Aug. 14, 2025(NAN) Wife of the Anambra Governor, Dr Nonye Soludo, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO), has announced the introduction of a statewide Measles-Rubella vaccination campaign scheduled to begin in February 2026.
The announcement was made on Thursday at the 3rd Anambra State Women Health Summit organised under the Healthy Living Initiative in collaboration with WHO and United Nations International Children�??s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), in Awka.
Dr Winifred Onodu, Measles-Rubella Diseases Programmes Officer for WHO in Anambra, described Rubella as a dangerous and deadly disease.
�??Rubella is a sister to measles but it it more dangerous and deadly. Pregnant women are mostly at risk because the virus can cause serious birth defects or miscarriage.
�??If a pregnant woman contracts rubella, especially in the first 12 weeks, the virus can cross the placenta and infect the fetus, leading to Congenital Rubella Syndrome.
�??This is why the government and partners introduced the Measles-Rubella vaccine into our Immunisation to protect our women and children,�?� she said.
Dr Mohamed Bonos, WHO Coordinator in Anambra, said the measles-rubella vaccination would commence from October 2025 to March 2026 across the country to prevent the spread of the disease.
�??Anambra state�??s Measles-Rubella vaccination will be in February 2026. We urge our mothers to take the message to the communities to protect our children,
�??We commend the governor�??s wife and the state government for fostering a partnership to advance the health and well-being of women and children,�?� he said.
In her keynote address, Soludo urged mothers to prioritise the health of their children by presenting them for immunisation.
�??Immunisation is a discovery that is meant to help your children, you should not keep your children away from taking these vaccines.
�??The measles-rubella vaccine is here. I encourage mothers to bring out their children from age nine to 14 years for immunisation to protect them from vaccines preventable diseases,�?� she said.
Soludo also emphasised the importance of exclusive breastfeeding, stating that it was the greatest gift a mother can give her child.
�??The natural breast milk given by God is far better than animal milk, which is often processed with unknown substances.
�??Exclusively breastfeeding your child can help them stay alert, healthy and free from many diseases,�?� she added
Speaking on gender-based violence, Soludo stated that the high level of violence in many homes was driven by economic hardship.
�??There is hardship in the land and everybody is feeling it, but I advise our women to talk less,�?� she said.
In his remarks, Dr Afam Obidike, the State Commissioner for Health, said the summit showed the state�??s commitment to women�??s and children�??s health.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the women received free eye examinations and glasses, as well as screenings for blood pressure, blood sugar levels, Body Mass Index, cervical cancer and breast cancer. (NAN)

"A�??Ibom: NEPC partners lawmaker, empowers 50 farmers in Etinan",Isaiah Eka,8/14/2025 20:21,Agriculture,"Empowerment
By Isaiah Eka
Etinan (Akwa Ibom), Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) in collaboration with Mr Paul Ekpo, the member representing Etinan Federal Constituency, has distributed oil palm seedlings and money to 50 farmers in the area.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Etinan Federal Constituency is made of Etinan, Nsit Ibom and Nsit Ubium Local Government Areas.
NAN further reports that each of the 50 farmers received 100 stands of oil palm seedlings and N100,000 to enhance palm oil production.
In her address, Mrs Nonye Ayeni, NEPC�??s Executive Director, said that the Federal Government was committed to empowering citizens in oil palm production business.
Represented by Mr Ben Etegbe, the South-South Regional Coordinator, Ayeni said that the empowerment was a deliberate move to position the country as a leading producer of palm oil.
She urged the beneficiaries to make judicious use of emerging opportunities in oil palm production, and described it as a lifetime investment.
The executive director further said that palm oil and its derivatives remained a huge investment opportunity, especially when processed for export.
�??It is estimated that as the population of people and industries that use palm oil and its derivatives increase, the demand for palm oil will also increase.
�??In Nigeria, palm oil production is an age-long occupation, particularly for the people of South-South and South-East regions. The business is sometimes passed on from one generation to another,�?� he said.
Ayeni said that Nigeria currently produced about 1.2 metric tons, which he said was grossly inadequate to satisfy the domestic annual consumption of over 2.5 metric tons.
�??Although Nigeria has huge potentials in palm oil to reclaim the leading position in terms of production and export, the potentials are not being harnessed effectively,�?� she said.
She said that the council would continue to work with critical stakeholders to reposition the industry, and to return Nigeria to being a net exporter of palm oil.
In his remarks, Ekpo thanked NEPC for its commitment to ensuring the success of the empowerment programme for members of his constituency.
Ekpo said that the empowerment programme aimed to step up the palm oil business from local to international market.
�??Palm oil production is the mainstay in agriculture, and you have a choice whether to produce and earn in naira or in foreign currency.
�??There is something in oil palm that most people do not realise, no part of oil palm is a waste. The oil palm you are seeing today will bring millionaires from among you tomorrow,�?� he said.
He urged beneficiaries not sell the oil palm seedlings, but to plant them and believe strongly that they would multiply in several folds.
Earlier, Mr Toju Mac-Jaja, the Principal Trade Promotion Officer, took the beneficiaries through different species of oil palm, its derivatives, planting methods, and business management techniques.
Speaking with NAN, one of the beneficiaries, Mr Emem Jimmy, thanked NEPC and the lawmaker for the empowerment programme.
He said that the move would make many to become self-reliant, and urged the state government and well-meaning indigenes to establish a standard oil processing mill in the area. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

"CISLAC seeks local govt autonomy, stronger traditional institutions",Onuegbu Perpetua,8/14/2025 20:18,Politics,"Autonomy
By Perpetua Onuegbu
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) has called for the repositioning of traditional institutions and the restoration of local government autonomy to promote development at the grassroots.
CISLAC Executive Director, Mr Auwal Rafsanjani, made the call at a stakeholders�?? roundtable on Thursday in Abuja
.
It was themed, �??Strengthening Local Government Autonomy and Formalising the Role of Traditional Institutions�?�
.
The event, with the sub-theme
�??What Next After the Zaria Declaration?�?�
, was organised by CISLAC and the Pan African Strategic and Policy Research Group (PANAFSTRAG).
Rafsanjani said the meeting was driven by a shared concern and collective hope to revitalise local governance and traditional authority for the benefit of communities nationwide.
He identified the absence of a clear governance framework, erosion of fiscal and administrative autonomy, and lack of transparency as major challenges weakening local government.
�??Our communities have been left vulnerable, underserved, and underrepresented. Traditional institutions, once vital to community cohesion, now struggle without legal backing, clarity of roles, or adequate resources,�?� he said.
Rafsanjani noted that the weakening of traditional authority had contributed to rising criminality.
�??If we are serious about tackling poverty, insecurity, exclusion, and inequality, we must start from the grassroots by dismantling elite capture and reviving local governments as engines of development and service delivery,�?� he added.
Executive Director of PANAFSTRAG, Gen. Olasehinde Williams (rtd), said Nigeria�??s constitutional gaps must be addressed to strengthen local governance.
He urged the Federal Government to stop taking on the roles of state and local governments, stressing that sustainable development must begin at the grassroots.
Williams criticised the practice of state governments paying traditional rulers, saying it made them loyal to politicians rather than their communities.
Director of Democracy and Governance at the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies, Dr Chris Ngara, said citizens must demand implementation of existing court rulings on local government autonomy.
�??Each of us belongs to a local government. If we all remain passive, this trend will continue,�?� he said.
Head of Local Government and Development Studies at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Dr Umar Dahiru, stressed the need for political, financial, and administrative independence for local governments.
He accused some state governments of using State Independent Electoral Commissions to install cronies who help siphon funds meant for local councils.
Dahiru called for full implementation of the Supreme Court judgement granting absolute autonomy to local governments. (NAN) www.nannews.ng

Cholera
By Ibrahim Bello
Birnin Kebbi,Aug. 14, 2024 (NAN) Doctors Without Borders/M??decins Sans Fronti??res (MSF) has raised concern over the rising cases of cholera in Zamfara, citing 1,500 cases from mid-June to early Aug.
The MSF�??s Medical Coordinator in Nigeria, Dr David Kizito, disclosed this in a statement issued to newsmen in Birnin Kebbi on Thursday.
Kizito cited high case numbers from three of the state�??s Ministry of Health (MOH) medical facilities it supports.
�??From mid-June to early August, the medical humanitarian organisation has recorded over 1,500 cases in these facilities, while other humanitarian actors and the MOH have also reported high incidence rates in other parts of the state.
�??This outbreak is unfolding in a context of insecurity, displacement, and limited access to clean water and sanitation �?? exacerbated by the rainy season,�?� he stated.
He argued that while cholera had been endemic to Nigeria for decades, �??seasonal outbreaks typically intensify between April and October�?�.
According to him, flooding during this period contaminates water sources, accelerating the spread of the disease in areas with poor sanitation.
�??Cholera can cause severe diarrhoea and vomiting.
�??If left untreated, it can lead to rapid dehydration and even death within hours.
�??In response to the outbreak, MSF has scaled up its water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions and promotional activities, alongside other humanitarian actors and the state MOH �?? which activated a Public Health Emergency Operations Centre on July 3.
�??MSF has particularly invested efforts in hotspot areas, like Shinkafi, Zurmi, and Talata Mafara, where access to safe water remains critically low.
�??Ensuring access to safe drinking water through boiling, practicing regular handwashing, consuming freshly prepared meals, avoiding open defecation, and keeping vaccinations up to date are straightforward yet highly effective measures to safeguard yourself and your family from preventable diseases,�?� Kizito added.
He stated that the organisation�??s medical teams were providing treatment at MSF-supported facilities across the state in its expansion of cholera medical treatment for preventative measures.
�??In mid-June, following the first suspected case of cholera at an MSF-supported medical facility, the organisation increased its case management and surveillance response in Zamfara, in addition to its scaled-up WASH activities.
�??In Zurmi, MSF and other humanitarian actors supported the MOH in opening a cholera treatment centre (CTC) in Zurmi General Hospital.
�??In July, MSF supported the MOH in opening a cholera treatment unit at the Talata Mafara General Hospital and a CTC at Shinkafi General Hospital.
�??In the Zurmi CTC, medical teams reported 562 suspected cases of cholera �?? the majority from Yambuki, Kadamusa, and Zurmi town �?? between June 16 and Aug. 5,�?� he added.
Kizito stated that at Shinkafi General Hospital, medical teams recorded approximately 401 cases between July 11 and Aug. 5, adding that the most affected areas were in Shinkafi North Ward, especially in Alkalawa, Sabon Gari and Kurya.
He noted that 58 cases originated from Isa LGA in Sokoto State, while in the Talata Mafara CTU, over 600 cases were recorded between July 1, and Aug. 8.
He stated that Kayaye accounted for the highest percentage of cases, �??but the CTU received cases as far as Anka and Bakura Local Government Areas (LGAs).
�??Going forward, MSF is worried there will be more cases.
�??As cholera continues to threaten lives across Zamfara, MSF remains committed to working alongside communities, health authorities, and other partners to ensure timely treatment, prevention, and support.
�??MSF emphasises the importance of setting up decentralised oral rehydration points and enabling all existing primary healthcare centres to treat mild and moderate suspected cholera cases.
�??This will ensure timely treatment, reduce complications, and allow prompt referral to dedicated CTCs in hospitals, such as Zurmi, Shinkafi, and Talata.
�??Moreover, urgent cholera vaccination is needed to halt transmission and save lives,�?� Kizito stated.
According to him, the participation of everyone in Zamfara is needed to reduce the spread.
�??No one should die from a preventable disease,�?� he stated. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

He said the Ministry of Entrepreneurship Development and PAWECA would provide follow-up business support, trader clinics on investment, savings and continuous monitoring to sustain the businesses.
Wadaragwo said more than 60,000 citizens had benefitted from the state�??s Technical Skills Acquisition Centres, with 10,000 new trainees recently shortlisted to select their preferred trades.
�??The state plans to establish a technology hub in partnership with the Bank of Industry and other stakeholders.

�??Advancing Builders�?? Knowledge and Skills for Effective Enforcement of Building Regulatory Laws for Sustainable Development�?�
.
It reflects the institute�??s commitment to strengthening professional competence, enforcing building regulations, and promoting sustainable practices in Nigeria�??s built environment.
According to Ewa, the safety and durability of buildings depend not only on the existence of regulatory laws but also on their effective enforcement.
�??Builders are one of the seven statutorily recognised professionals in the built environment, and construction plays a central role in ensuring that every stage of building complies with approved designs, quality standards, and legal requirements.
�??Unfortunately, incidents of building collapse and substandard construction remain a major concern, often due to weak enforcement or lack of professional oversight,�?� he said.
Ewa said the conference would address these gaps through capacity building, policy engagement, and professional collaboration.
He noted that while some states were already enforcing building regulatory laws, others were still in the process of domesticating them.
He stressed the need for uniform adoption of these laws nationwide, adding that the NIOB was also concerned about the quality of construction materials.
�??That�??s why we started the construction of a skill laboratory project in Lugbe, to enable stakeholders test materials during construction work,�?� he said.
The NIOB president further urged greater involvement of professionals in structural and town planning processes.
He lamented that the Nigerian Building Code (NBC), which sets standards for design, construction, and maintenance of buildings, had yet to be passed by the Senate since it was proposed in 2006.
Ewa explained that the NBC addresses key aspects such as structural integrity, fire safety, energy efficiency, and accessibility.
�??While we continue sensitisation, the delay in passing some of these laws gives room for quacks to thrive. This is why some states have introduced their own laws to curb building collapse.
�??When proper laws are in place, with material testing and professional oversight, and discipline is maintained in the industry, all will be well,�?� he said.

Terrorists
By Sumaila Ogbaje
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Nigerian Army has recorded major operational gains across the country in the past three days, neutralising scores of terrorists, and apprehended no fewer than 17 criminal suspects.
A credible source at Army Headquarters told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday that the breakthroughs followed a series of coordinated raids, ambushes, and targeted strikes in Borno, Yobe, Zamfara, Kebbi, Plateau, Taraba, and the South-East.
The source revealed that a total 25 family members of Islamic States of West African Province (ISWAP) fighters surrendered to troops in the North-East.
According to the source, they surrendered to troops of 202 Battalion, operating in Bama Local Government Area (LGA) of Borno, on Aug. 11.
He said the 25 family members comprised 12 adult females and 13 children who surrendered from the Zalmari, Gazuwa, and Alafa axis.
�??The surrendered persons are currently undergoing detailed profiling by the 21 Special Armoured Brigade.
�??On the same day in Yobe State, troops of 233 Battalion, in conjunction with the Civilian JTF, conducted an ambush along the Sassawa�??Kaburu route in Damaturu LGA, engaging terrorists, neutralising one, and recovering an AK-47 rifle,�?� he said.
In Zamfara, the source revealed that troops of 1 Brigade Combat Team 5 foiled a planned terrorist attack on FOB Galadi in Shinkafi LGA, killing one terrorist and seizing a mobile phone used for operational coordination.
The source added that troops on Aug. 12, acting on intelligence from a rescued kidnap victim, stormed Gremasa Mountain in Shanga LGA of Kebbi and apprehended eight suspected kidnappers believed to be behind several recent abductions in the area.
In Plateau, he said the troops of Sector 4, Operation Safe Haven, nabbed five suspected pipeline vandals at Kassa Village in Barkin Ladi LGA.
He said the suspects were caught with government-owned pipes and subsequently handed over to the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) for further investigation.
�??Similarly, in Taraba, troops of Sector 3 FOB Wukari, under Operation Whirl Stroke, apprehended two suspected kidnap collaborators.
�??Items recovered from them included POS machines, ATM cards, and cash believed to be linked to ransom transactions.
On Aug. 13, troops of 34 Artillery Brigade launched a coordinated offensive on an IPOB/ESN camp at Ndeji Community, a border area between Anambra, Abia, and Imo States.
�??One armed member was neutralised, and troops recovered a pistol with ammunition, cartridges, handheld radios, components for improvised explosive devices (IEDs), mobile phones, and other operational equipment.
�??Two IEDs planted by the criminals were safely destroyed by the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team.
�??These sustained operations demonstrate the Nigerian Army�??s resolve to dismantle terrorist networks, disrupt their logistics, and deny them safe havens, while safeguarding farmers and communities,�?� the source said.
He reaffirmed that the army would maintain relentless pressure on terrorists, bandits, separatists, and other criminal groups until peace and stability are fully restored across all regions of the country. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)

Endowment
By Mujidat Oyewole
Ilorin, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) Prof. Sidiqat Aderinoye-Abdulwahab of the Department of Agricultural Extension and Rural Development, University of Ilorin, has endowed N1.5 million prize for the best male and female students of agriculture in the institution.
Aderinoye-Abdulwahab made the endowment during the 289th Inaugural Lecture of the institution, delivered by her on Thursday, saying that the donation was her way of giving back to the society.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the lecture delivered had as its theme: �??Sustainable, Smart and Safe Pastoralism in Nigeria�?�.
�??As a way of giving back to the society and encouraging future generations of womenfolk, I pledge N750,000 for the next ten years to the best male graduating student.
�??This is in honour of my husband for his unwavering spirit, unflinching support and overwhelming dedication towards my success,�?� she said.
The don also donated N750,000 to the best graduating female student in agriculture in memory of Hajiya Fauziyah Ali for directing her towards the acquisition of a PhD that culminated her achievement.
Aderinoye-Abdulwahab advised the Ministry of Livestock Development to promote safe pastoralism by educating and enlightening pastoralists as well as create conflict mediation units that will serve the need of pastoralists.
She urged policy makers to formulate and implement relevant pastoral policies that would enhance the implementation of existing grazing reserves and ranching.
The expert said that the practice of herding and grazing ruminant animals has a long and varied history and could be traced to Stone Age period.
�??The story of Cain and Abel�??s conflict is proof that farmer/herdsmen conflict and altercations have a history rooted in ancient period.
�??It serves as a timeless metaphor for struggles between different livelihoods, cultures and identities. Correspondingly, today�??s clashes between farmers and herders stem from deeper tensions of competition for scarce resources,�?� she said.
Aderinoye-Abdulwahab explained that migration could occur either because the environmental quality of a habitat has become unliveable or migrant�??s economic outcome was better in areas with greater resource availability.
�??One basic feature of herdsmen is migration but the effects of migration on host communities�?? farms includes pressure on land, cultural and social differences, over population and social disorganisation, which are conflict triggers.
The expert said that the complex interplay of livelihood, environmental and social insecurity challenges facing pastoralism in Nigeria requires a multifaceted solution.
�??As we strive for an aggregation of sustainable, smart and safe pastoralism in Nigeria, I will like to leave us with the words of our creator, who reminds us thus:
�??And He created the cattle for you; in them is warmth and numerous benefits and from them you eat,�?� she quoted. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)

Marshals
By Diana Omueza
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has unveiled Ibironke Ariyo, Senior Correspondent with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Nedu Wazobia and 21 other notable Nigerians as its Celebrity Special Marshals (CSMs).
The unveiling took place on Thursday in Abuja during the 2025 Road Safety Youth Hangout organised by the FRSC-FCT Command, themed: �??Safer Roads, Brighter Future: Youth Leading the Change.�?�
The Assistant Corps Marshal (ACM), who doubled as the Corps Public Education Officer (CPEO),Olusegun Ogungbemide said that the CSMs were selected to champion road safety advocacy nationwide.
Ogungbemide said the initiative was anchored by the FCT Sector Command in line with the policy thrust of the Corps Marshal, Malam Shehu Mohammed, which recognised that road safety was a shared responsibility.
�??Engagement of youths and influential personalities is crucial in reversing current crash trends.
�??We believe the youth have a major role to play because they are mostly affected during crashes and with this set of marshals we are certainly going to record lesser road incidents,�?� he said.
Ogungbemide urged the celebrity special marshals to use their influence and social engagement platforms to drive road safety advocacy, influence positive peer behaviour, and promote safe driving culture.
He also encouraged the adoption of the FRSC mobile app as a key tool in preventing crashes, noting that its functions empower road users to contribute to safer roads while on transit.
According to him, the functionality of the mobile app is so huge that each feature plays a role in reducing road traffic crashes.
�??The app is youth centric and we believe adoption of this platform will help accomplish the Corps Marshal�??s vision of safer roads,�?� he said.
He said that with youths leading the campaign for safer roads, Nigeria would move forward boldly, safely, and united.
NAN reports that according to FRSC records, between January and December 2024, Nigeria recorded 9,570 road traffic crashes, with 31,154 injuries and 5,421 deaths.
Meanwhile, global figures record Road Traffic Crashes (RTCs) as the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5�??29 years, with two-thirds of fatalities occurring among people aged 18�??59.
Ariyo, one of the celebrity special marshals, expressed gratitude to the FRSC for the recognition of her advocacy against speed, reckless driving, use of phones while driving and other activities that lead to road crashes.
�??As a journalist, I have reported extensively on road safety to create awareness on dangers associated with road usage and how to avert them.
�??This is a great responsibility to intensify my advocacy for safer roads and rides and I pledge to support FRSC�??s mission to save lives and properties,�?� she said.
Ariyo said that being a celebrity special marshal gives an additional platform to not just report, but actively advocate for safer roads.
The NAN reports that other nominees include: Munirat Antoinette Lecky of Big Brother Naija, Oyeyemi Ajayi of NTA, Kayode Oyedare of FRCN, Benny Ark of Channels TV, and Ozi Okoli of Arise News. (NAN)(www.nannews.)

NWAPDI�??s National Coordinator, Omolara Svensson, stated this at the official unveiling of group�??s Sovereign Agrotrade System (SAS) and summit on Thursday in Abuja.
The SAS is?�?�a groundbreaking digital and physical trade infrastructure designed to connect Nigerian farmers, especially women and youth directly to national and international markets.
The theme of the summit is �?� Building Wealth from the Soil-Digitally and Inclusively.�?�
Svensson said that the SAS integrated four major innovation namely, AgriXchange Marketplace, NWAPDI Grow, AgriCert, and FarmAssure.
She explained that through agriXchange marketplace, NWAPDI�??s members could connect directly with buyers, input suppliers, and service providers, irrespective of location.
�?� Their products will be visible, valued, and purchased across Nigeria and beyond.
�?� Through NWAPDI grow, farmers can save securely, receive direct payments, and access microloans to turn a good harvest into a thriving agribusiness.
�?� No more endless queues at the bank or waiting for promises that never come,�?� she said.
Svensson said that through AgriCert, every harvest would carry a stamp of quality, traceability, and trust, opening doors to premium markets and guaranteeing fair, prompt, and secure payment.
�?� Through farmassure, members can plan, track, and manage their farms like businesses, with digital records that attract investors, secure insurance, and enable smarter decisions,�?� she said.
In his address, the Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Security, Sen. Aliyu Abdullahi, said the SAS platform
aligned?� with the vision of President Bola Tinubu, under the Renewed Hope Agenda(RHA).
Abdullahi said the RHA placed agriculture, digital innovation, inclusivity, and grassroots empowerment at the very heart of Nigeria�??s economic revival.
The minister was represented by Mr?� Mohammed Jobdi, his Special Adviser on Strategy.
He said that the digital ecosystem created by NWAPDI would transform agriculture from subsistence to significance.
�?�?� This initiative is a landmark contribution to the national agricultural transformation journey.
�?� To our farmers here today,?� especially our hardworking women and energetic and committed youth, this is your time.
�?� This is your platform. This is your power. You are no longer left behind.
�??You are now at the center of a new Nigeria, one where the farmer becomes a respected entrepreneur.
�?� The youth becomes a digital agripreneur, and the woman becomes a bankable investor in her community�??s food system,�?� he said.
Earlier, Mr Dion Croom, President, Norcom, LLC, and Lead Consortium Partner,?� said the AgroTrade system was developed to empower women and youth in agriculture.
Croom said that the system also aimed to promote food security and sustainable farming practices.

By Segun Giwa
Akure, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) Mr Ahmed Akintola, Director of Urban Development, Federal Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, says the Federal Government is planning to provide 500 housing units in each state of the federation.
He said that additional 1000 units would also be provided in the Renewed Hope City in the six geopolitical zones.
Akintola stated this during a courtesy visit to the state Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Mr Sunday Olajide, on Thursday in Akure.
He added 100 housing units would be provided in each of the 774 Local Government Areas, while economic housing units would also be provided in all the farm settlement across the country.
Akintola said he was in the state with a team of building experts and consulting firm to conduct housing deficit survey in Akure, with the aim of understanding the level of housing shortages to initiate inclusive housing development in the state.
�??This is part of the Federal Government initiative for broader national programme aimed at generating accurate and up-to-date data on housing demand and supply gaps, housing quality and access to basic services which is in line with the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs),�?� he said.

MSF raises alarm over escalating cholera outbreak in Zamfara,Folasade Akpan,8/14/2025 19:17,Health,"MSF raises alarm over escalating cholera outbreak in Zamfara
Cholera
By Folasade Akpan/08059110536
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) M??decins Sans Fronti??res (MSF), has expressed concern over the rising number of cholera cases in Zamfara State, calling for action to avert more loss of lives.
The medical humanitarian organisation, also known as Doctors Without Borders, raised the alarm in a statement it issued on Thursday.
MSF�??s Medical Coordinator in Nigeria, Dr David Kizito, said that already, more than 1, 500 cases from three medical facilities the MSF had been supporting in the state.
He added that other humanitarian actors and the state�??s Ministry of Health had also reported high incidence rates in other parts of Zamfara.
He said MSF had focused its response on hotspot areas such as Shinkafi, Zurmi, and Talata Mafara, where access to safe water remains critically low.
According to him, while cholera has been endemic in Nigeria for decades, seasonal outbreaks often intensify between April and October.
�??�??Flooding during the period contaminates water sources, accelerating the spread of the disease in areas with poor sanitation.
�??Cholera causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, and if untreated, can lead to rapid dehydration and death within hours,�?� he said.
Kizito also said that MSF had scaled up its Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) interventions and health promotion activities.
This, he said, was alongside other humanitarian actors and the ministry of health, which activated a Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) on July 3.
On expansion of cholera treatment, he said that MSF had began services in the state in mid-June, following the first suspected case at one of its supported facilities.
According to him, this included boosting case management and surveillance, alongside scaled-up WASH activities.
�??�??In Zurmi, MSF and other humanitarian actors supported the ministry in opening a Cholera Treatment Centre (CTC) at Zurmi General Hospital.
�??�??In July, it also assisted the ministry in setting up a Cholera Treatment Unit (CTU) at Talata Mafara General Hospital and a CTC at Shinkafi General Hospital,�??�?? he said.
Kizito said that between June 16 and August 5, the Zurmi CTC reported 562 suspected cases, mostly from Yambuki, Kadamusa, and Zurmi town.
He added that in Shinkafi General Hospital, about 401 cases were recorded between July 11 and August 5, and the worst-affected areas being Shinkafi North Ward, particularly Alkalawa, Sabon Gari, and Kurya.
He further said that 58 cases came from Isa LGA which has a border with Sokoto state.
�??�??At the Talata Mafara CTU, more than 600 cases were recorded between July 1 and August 8, with Kayaye accounting for the highest percentage; cases also came from Anka and Bakura LGAs,�??�?? he said.
MSF�??s Medical Coordinator in Nigeria said the outbreak was unfolding in a context of insecurity, displacement, and limited access to clean water and sanitation.
The situation, he said, was exacerbated by the rainy season.
He, however, assured of MSF�??s continuous commitment to working alongside communities, health authorities, and other partners to ensure timely treatment, prevention, and support.
�??MSF emphasises the importance of setting up decentralised oral rehydration points and enabling all existing primary healthcare centres to treat mild and moderate suspected cholera cases.
�??This will ensure timely treatment, reduce complications, and allow prompt referral to dedicated CTCs in hospitals such as Zurmi, Shinkafi, and Talata.
�??Moreover, urgent cholera vaccination is needed to halt transmission and save lives,�??�?? he said.
Kizito said that participation of everyone in Zamfara was needed to reduce the spread, stating, �??�??no one should die from a preventable disease.�?�
MSF Head of Mission in Nigeria, Dr Ahmad Bilal, encouraged abiding by certain hygiene practices to reduce the risk of contracting the disease.
�??Access to safe drinking water through boiling, practising regular handwashing, consuming freshly prepared meals, avoiding open defecation.
�??Also, keeping vaccinations up to date are straightforward yet highly effective measures to safeguard yourself and your family from preventable diseases,�?� (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

Probe
By Taiye Agbaje
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) No fewer than 14, 000 Nigerian investors have prayed the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate activities of a cryptocurrency firm, MTS/TOFRO, over alleged N1.8 trillion investment fraud.
The petitioners, though their lawyer, Ebuka Nwaeze, also urged the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate the extent of the firm�??s compliance with the commission�??s regulations and the allegation of its collapse.
While a petition addressed to the EFCC�??s chairman was received on Aug. 6, the petition written to the SEC DG was received on Aug. 13.
The certified true copies of the documents were made available to newsmen on Thursday in Abuja.
Nwaeze urged the EFCC to investigate the matter, trace, recover and redistribute the funds of his clients and prosecute any person found culpable in the alleged unlawful activity.
He said this would serve as a deterrence �??to other fraudulent characters from doing so and to altogether shore up the cyber security reputation of Nigeria.�?�
It reads: �??We are solicitors to Nigerians of various walks of life who engaged in digital trading on the cryptocurrency trading platform known as MTS/TOFRO crypto trading platform.
�??Our clients number over 14 million Nigerians, who are registered traders on the trading platform, where legitimate exchange and trade of digital assets were being carried out under an ostensibly secure digital platform.
�??Our clients�?? enlistment and participation on the platform was in good faith, being that MTS/TOFRO is a reputable organisation registered in the United States of America and its platform enjoys wide participation in America as well as in various counties in Europe.�?�
The lawyer alleged that the operators of the platform capitalised on the SEC�??s call for regulation of crypto trading platforms to convince investors that they were already in the process of registration and reopening of the platform after full compliance, while they closed down their physical offices.
He said many of his clients, being law abiding citizens, considered and found the activity of the platform to be in consonance with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (2020-2030), which encourages Nigerians to participate in the digital economy.
He said this was so since the Federal Government �??proclaimed active pursuit of digital transformation to create jobs and increase the contribution of the digital economy to the Nigerian GDP from about 14.3% to 21% by the year 2030.�?�
The EFCC�??s Head, Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale, confirmed that the commission received the petition.
�??The matter involving MTS/OFRO is currently before the commission,�?� he said..(NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

Partnership
By Jacinta Nwachukwu
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) A non-governmental organisation (NGO), Plan International Nigeria, says it will partner with Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) to drive stronger advocacy for women and youths in Bauchi and Sokoto states.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the partnership between the two parties was sealed through the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on Thursday in Abuja.
The NGO�??s Director of Programme Quality and Influencing, Dr Helen Idiong, said that the collaboration was aimed at driving stronger advocacy, amplifying visibility and strengthening capacity building for women�??s rights and youth-led organisations in the two states.
Idiong stated that the initiative would be actualised under its Plan International Nigeria�??s Adolescent Girls and Young Women�??s Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (ASPIRE) project, aiming to impact 20 million girls in five years.
According to her, the ASPIRE project, funded by Global Affairs Canada, works to dismantle barriers to sexual and reproductive health and rights for adolescent girls and young women.
�??It will also advance gender equality and inclusive participation in decision-making by creating an enabling environment for local organisations to thrive.
�??We believe that whatever is causing the girls to be down there, issues around poverty, discrimination?�and all of the patriarchal things that affect girls, if they are removed, girls will have?�a better life.
�??And you will agree with me that when girls are in their best elements, the country and the home will be better for all.
�??No one can tell a woman�??s story better than a woman herself. And so all of the great work that we are doing in our project in Sokoto, Bauchi, across the space, it�??s only we women who can tell the story the way it should be told,�?� she said.
Idiong highlighted the organisation�??s programmes to include: policy engagement and partnership building to address systemic barriers, amplification of girls�?? voices and creation of enabling environment where children and young people, especially girls, can learn, lead, decide and thrive.
This, she said, was to ensure that their priorities shaped public discourse and advanced their rights in policy and practice.
In her remarks, the National President of NAWOJ, Aisha Ibrahim, appreciated the organisation for the initiative, saying that it underscored its commitment to advocating for gender equality and the rights of every child.
Ibrahim said that NAWOJ actively engaged in advocacy on societal and humanitarian issues, particularly focusing on persons of concern, including orphans and vulnerable children, among others.
�??This partnership is not merely a formality, it is a declaration of our united vision, a vision that seeks to create a world where children and girls can thrive, where their voices are heard and where their rights are upheld.
�??Through this collaborative framework on the ASPIRE project, we will implement strategic capacity-building initiatives designed to empower the local women�??s rights and youth-led organisations as well as enhance their skills,�?� she said.

Ibadan, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) Most Rev. David Onuoha, the President,
Christian Council of Nigeria (CCN), has commended the Federal Government�??s courage in introducing reforms to tackle Nigeria�??s decades-long economic and social challenges.
He gave the commendation on Thursday at the CCN 2025 Standing Committee meeting held at Institute of Church and Society in Ibadan.

The CCN president also said that such economic problems could not be resolved overnight, and advised citizens to be patient and leaders to be sincere to achieve lasting economic transformation.
The cleric lamented the severe hunger, anger and bitterness in the country, calling for urgent government intervention to avert potential social unrest.
Onuoha urged state governors to heed President Tinubu�??s call on them to utilise increased allocations available at their disposal effectively.
He insisted that mere admonition was insufficient to address the daily hunger and frustration confronting millions of Nigerians.
The cleric decried non-compliance with the Supreme Court�??s ruling on local government autonomy, advocating innovative accountability mechanisms as legislative bodies in many states appear under executive influence.
Onuoha expressed concern over persistent insecurity in spite significant investments, describing the toll on citizens, property and security forces while demanding a reassessment of security strategies.
He said that fifth columnists sabotaging national security efforts must be identified and punished.
The cleric warned that peace, stability, and development could remain elusive without decisive as well as coordinated action.(NAN)(

"Katsina, UNICEF collaborate to modernise Tsangaya education system",Bamalli Abbas,8/14/2025 18:53,Education,"Katsina, UNICEF collaborate to modernise Tsangaya education system
Tsangaya
By Abbas Bamalli
Katsina, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Katsina State Government, has partnered the United Nations Children Funds (UNICEF), to integrate core-subjects into the Tsangaya education system in the state.
Mr Muntaka Mukhtar, an Education Specialist with UNICEF Kano Field Office, disclosed this in Katsina on Thursday at a workshop organised for Tsangaya school proprietors.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the workshop was organised through the state�??s Agency for Mass Education, with support from UNICEF.
According to Mukhtar, the aim was to ensure that all the children are in school.
He said, �??At UNICEF, we always promote that education is a right of the child and should be given that right.
�??And we�??re aware that Katsina is facing a lot of security challenges which are likely going to hinder many children from going to school.
�??So, we�??re trying to see how we ensure that some of these tsangaya school operators who are running the Qur�??anic schools, allow their children to have quality basic education within their own environment.�?�
The education specialist expressed the belief that wherever children were, they can learn, and they can benefit from whatever they learn in future.
He explained that the exercise was aimed at interacting with the Tsangaya school operators to see that they permit all these children to continue to also acquire the western education.
Mukhtar said, �??What we�??re trying now is to see that at least these children are not denied their right to education, and they are supported to maximise their own potential as much as they can.
�??We had a similar exercise last year, we had another number more than this. This time is only 100 based on what we can think.
�??But, we are not only picking numbers, we�??re looking at those that have a large number of children under them, and are also willing to allow them to assess quality basic education.�?�
He further expressed hope that the government would sustain this kind of engagement as their own responsibility.
According to him, at the end of the exercise, the participants are expected to come up with an action plan on how they are going to position their centres to integrate core subjects, especially English language, mathematics, among others.
Also, one of the facilitators at the workshop, Prof. Umar Alqali, from the Faculty of Law, University of Maiduguri, said Katsina had more than 8,000 tsangaya schools, with no fewer than 500,000 children.
He highlighted the importance of the exercise, especially considering the above mentioned number of the Tsangaya schools and the children across the state.
�??With this, we�??ve to come to terms with the fact that we can�??t allow this huge number of our population to go without giving them the Western education, which is of course, needed for day to day activities.
�??We intend to support this process without interfering with the primary essence of the schools, which is the memorisation of the Holy Qur�??an,�?� he said.
Earlier, the UNICEF focal person at the state�??s agency for Mass Education, Malam Abdulbaki Lawal-Lema, said the exercise was important because the world is revolving towards western education.
He said, �??This batch comprises six local government areas of Rimi, Katsina, Mani, Baure, Kafur and Kankara where 100 proprietors were selected for this purpose.
�??They are being taught the importance of integration of western education into the Almajiri system of education to learn the basics.�?�(NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

By Olawale Akinremi
Ibadan, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) A Mapo Grade �??A�?? Customary Court in Ibadan on Thursday remanded a 26-year-old suspected fraudster, Musa Jafar, over an alleged fraud of N450,000 and certificate forgery.
Jafar, however, pleaded not guilty to the five-count charge, bordering on conspiracy, false pretence, fraudulent obtaining and forgery, brought against him.
Following his not-guilty plea, the court�??s President, Mrs S.M. Akintayo, admitted him to bail in the sum of N400,000 with two sureties in like sum.
Akintayo added that one of the sureties must be a blood relation and the other, a community leader.
She added that they must both show evidence of tax payments to the Oyo State Government.
Subsequently, she adjourned the hearing of the case to Aug. 28.
The prosecuting counsel, Insp Ayodeji Ayeni, had earlier informed the court that the defendant allegedly committed the crime sometime in June 2024 at the Basorun area of Ibadan.
Ayeni said Jafar, with others at large, fraudulently obtained N450,000 from one Ms Naimat Oladepo, deceiving her that she would be taught some professional courses in Information, Communication and Technology (ICT).
The prosecutor also noted that the defendant presented a forged certificate to the complainant to prove that he was an expert in the field of ICT.
According to Ayeni, the offences contravened the provisions of Section 516, 419, 467 and 390 (9) of the Criminal Code, Cap 38, Vol. II, Laws of Oyo State 2000. (NAN)(

By Stella Kabruk
Distribution
Kaduna,Aug.14,2025(NAN) The Kaduna State Contributory Health Management Authority, has commenced the distribution of identity cards to 15,916 vulnerables, pregnant women and children under five years under the Health Insurance Scheme.
Speaking at the lunch of the distribution on Thursday in Kaduna, the state Deputy Governor, Dr Hadiza Balarabe,
said the initiative?� was aimed at enhancing the well-being of the citizens.
She said health was a fundamental human right, adding, �??it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that every citizen, regardless of their socio-economic status, has access to quality healthcare.�?�
According to her, in the country today,
over 70 per cent?� of healthcare spending is still out-of-pocket, a heavy burden that breaks the backs of the poor.
She said the health insurance scheme was the bridge from vulnerability to security, from exclusion to inclusion, from despair to dignity.
Balarabe said, �??Let this initiative be a catalyst for further actions.
�??We must continue to advocate programmes that uplift our vulnerable populations, ensuring that no one is excluded in our pursuit for health equity.
�??We are not just distributing cards, but offering care,?� delivering compassion, and demonstrating commitment to a cause greater than ourselves, the cause of health for all, hope for all, and help for all.
�??Our journey is not yet over, our job is not yet done, and our duty is not yet fulfilled together, we will strive to create a Kaduna State where everyone has the opportunity to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.�?�
She added that the distribution was a clear confirmation of government�??s boundless commitment to expanding access to quality healthcare.
Balarabe added, �??We hold firm to the conviction that no citizen should be left behind, no community should be overlooked, and no life should be lost simply because they cannot afford the needed care.
�??From the moment His Excellency,?� Uba Sani, assumed office, the administrations�?? mission has been clear: bring healthcare closer, make healthcare cheaper, and ensure healthcare is better.
�??We have revitalized Primary Health Centers and General Hospitals; we have equipped them, staffed them, and powered them.
�??This is because a healthy people make a stronger Kaduna, a stronger Kaduna makes a stronger Nigeria, and a stronger Nigeria serves, all of us.�?�
According to her,the government investments in health transcend beyond buildings and equipment, to touch lives.
�?� These investments are translating to women who can now deliver safely, children who can now grow healthy, and families who can now live without the fear of medical bills pushing them into poverty,�?�,the deputy governor said.
She appreciated donor agencies and development allies: UNICEF, the Gates Foundation,?� the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and others?� for support
Balarabe added, �?� I single out the Clinton Health Access because their direct enrollment of over 20,000 vulnerable persons, mostly women, into this scheme is a powerful proof of what partnerships can produce.
�?� Our traditional rulers,?� thank you for using that influence to mobilize your people for health.
�??To philanthropic individuals and organizations, you are planting seeds of service whose harvest will be measured in healthier generations.�?�
She appealed?� to corporate bodies, philanthropists and community leaders, to support more families and strengthen shared future.
In her remarks ,the state Commissioner for Health , Umma Ahmed, said the distribution was a bold statement of the?� administration�??s unwavering determination to ensure that no woman or child in the state?� was denied access to quality healthcare due to financial barriers.
She said the?� initiative, which built on the Memorandum of Understanding signed in August 2023, had already recorded an impressive milestone�??31,165 beneficiaries enrolled to date, surpassing the original target of 20,000.
Ahmed added that beyond the numbers, the impact of the distribution would be felt in the improved access to life-saving maternal, newborn, and child health services across all primary healthcare facilities.
She said, �??It is a step towards reducing maternal and child mortality rates, improving health outcomes, and building a healthier, more resilient Kaduna State.�?�
Ahmed called on community leaders, political appointees, health workers, and media partners to help spread the message of hope, encouraging other eligible individuals to enroll and take advantage of the scheme.
She appreciated the state Governor
for his continued investments in the health sector, and to all the partners and stakeholders for their steadfast commitment.
�?� Together, we are building a future where every resident of Kaduna State can access quality healthcare, regardless of their socio-economic status,�?�Ahmed said.
Earlier in an opening remark,the Director-General of the authority, Abubakar Hassan, said the distribution was a promised fulfilled by the government.
He said the governor approved the enrollment of 70,000 vulnerables into the scheme so as to gain access to affordable health care.
According to him, the 70,000 are from the formal sector and they needed to do more to boost the informal sector.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

FCTA continues onslaught on criminal hideouts in Abuja,Philip Daniel Yatai,8/14/2025 18:32,Defence/Security,"Demolition
By Philip Yatai
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The City Sanitation Taskforce of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has demolished a criminal hideout in Apo Resettlement, Abuja, in continuation of its ongoing onslaught on criminal hideouts across the capital city.
Mr Mukhtar Galadima, Director of Development Control, who heads the operation told journalists during the exercise on Thursday, that the location had been contributing to the insecurity in Apo and environs.
Galadima described the area as one of the identified �??dark spots�?� inhabited by criminal elements in the city, with reported killings by miscreants living in the area.
This, according to him, had made the area a huge security threat to other residents.
�??This is part of the continuation of the city sanitation operations to rid the city of criminal elements.
�??This place has been identified as one of the notorious dark spots in the city and we are here to clear the area to make it safe for residents.
�??There are credible and verifiable security and intelligence reports about these locations. In fact, there were instances where some people were even killed around this area.
�??So, for the fact that this place was identified as a dark spot, it�??s enough for it to be demolished, cleared and removed everything, including the fence.
He said that the step was part of the FCTA�?? s measures to keep miscreants away from green areas and empty plots of land.
Mr Adamu Gwary, Director, Security Services Department, FCTA, confirmed that residents of the area had been complaining about criminal activities in the area.
Gwary, who was represented by the Secretary, Command and Control Centre, Dr Peter Olumuji said that apart from a safe haven for suspected armed robbers, illicit drug peddling also thrive in the area.
�??Some few weeks ago, there was an attack on residents and the criminals hid in the area.
�??Over 50 armed robbers came here to attack the residents here, but the quick response from the FCT Police Command and sister agencies prevented that attack from snowballing�?�, he said.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the taskforce on Aug. 6, demolished illegal structures and shanties in Wuse Zone 3, and moved to UTC for a similar exercise on Monday.
The taskforce also demolished illegal structures and shanties, popularly known as �??Cashew Garden�?� in Apo Cadastral Zone E27, Abuja, on Tuesday.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) �??The Customs Consultative Committee (CCC) has urged its members to remain calm amid the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) planned review of licence fees for licenced customs agents.
The Chairman of the CCC, Hakeem Olanrewaju, made the call in a statement on Thursday.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the NCS recently announced that it had begun consultations with key stakeholders ahead of its planned review of licence renewal fees for licenced customs agents.
The implementation of the fees is set to take effect in January 2026.
Olanrewaju urged practitioners to go about their respective businesses without tension, emphasising the importance of obedience to laws and regulations.
�??We appreciate the NCS�??s commitment to an inclusive process and look forward to continued collaboration and fair negotiations, �?? he said.
Olanrewaju?� said that the NCS recently invited the leadership of freight forwarding to discuss the review pursuant to its statutory mandate under Sections 103 to 107 of the NCS Act, 2023.
He said that during the meeting, the Comptroller-,General (C-G), Mr Bashir Adewale emphasised that the enforcement of the four per cent Fee On Board (FOB) was not negotiable, as it was in line with the provisions of the NCS Act, 2023.

Allegation
By Hussaina Yakubu
Kaduna, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Kaduna State Government has rejected allegations by the African Democratic Congress (ADC) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) of plans to sabotage Saturday�??s bye-elections, describing the claims as �??laughable lies�?� and a distraction by �??political leftovers�?� of former Governor Nasir El-Rufai.
The ADC/SDP coalition, led by the ADC National Vice Chairman (North-West), Mr Jafaru Sani, had on Thursday accused the state government of recruiting thugs, inducing electoral officials, and planning large-scale vote buying.
This,it alleged, is to influence the outcome of the bye-elections in Chikun/Kajuru Federal Constituency and the State Constituencies in Zaria and Sabon-Gari LGAs.
According to the statement, the coalition uncovered what it described as a coordinated scheme involving recruitment of over 4,000?� thugs to intimidate opposition supporters at polling units and collation centres.
But responding at a press briefing in Kaduna, the Commissioner-designate for Information, Mr Ahmed Maiyaki, said the accusations were �??baseless, mischievous and a desperate attempt to discredit an election the coalition knows it cannot win.�?�
Maiyaki, who addressed journalists alongside the Commissioner for Local Government, Mr Sadiq Mamman-Lagos, said the poor turnout at the coalition�??s recent rallies showed their lack of support, adding that their press statement was a �??face-saving effort ahead of their impending defeat.�?�
He dismissed the claim that plots of land were being offered to INEC officials as inducement, as well as the allegation that a �??disgraced former senator�?� was coordinating the deployment of funds for electoral manipulation.
According to him, the conduct of elections is the sole responsibility of INEC and not the state government.
�??We will not sit idly by while political opportunists smear the name of our administration and malign innocent officials with wild, unsubstantiated claims,�?� Maiyaki said.
He added that the state�??s legal team had been directed to review the coalition�??s allegations for possible legal redress.
Making reference to the past, Maiyaki alleged that former Gov. El-Rufai once ordered thugs to attack the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Secretariat in Kaduna, saying such acts of political violence were alien to the leadership style of Gov. Uba Sani.
He stated that the Governor was currently in Chikun Local Government Area to inaugurate the construction of Romi Karatudu township roads, �??a community that was abandoned and demolished during El-Rufai�??s eight years in office.�?�
Maiyaki maintained that?�Sani�??s administration had promoted unity and inclusive governance, which, according to him, had unsettled opposition figures.
�??Democracy in Kaduna is alive and thriving and no amount of theatre from El-Rufai�??s political leftovers in ADC will change that,�?� he said.
Also speaking, Mamman-Lagos denied the coalition�??s claim that local governments were forced to contribute funds for election interference.
He described El-Rufai as �??a frustrated politician who is sinking and wants to drag others along.�?�
The state government urged voters to disregard the allegations and turn out en masse on Saturday to exercise their civic rights peacefully.(NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

Partnership
By Doris Esa
Abuja, Aug.14, 2025 (NAN) The Federal Government is collaborating with the?� Nigeria Women in Agriculture Progressive Development Initiative ( NWAPDI) to equip small holder farmers with the tools to thrive in?� technology-driven marketplace.
The?�Minister of State for Agriculture and Food Security, Sen. Aliyu Abdullahi, stated this?�at the?�NWAPDI�??s Sovereign Agrotrade System (SAS) official unveiling and?� summit on Thursday in Abuja.
The Sovereign AgroTrade System which is?�?�a groundbreaking digital and physical trade infrastructure designed to connect Nigerian farmers, especially women and youth directly to national and international markets.
The theme of the summit is �?�?�Building Wealth from the Soil-Digitally and Inclusively.�?�
The minister who was represented by his Special Adviser on Strategy, Mr Mohammed Jobdi, said the initiative is a landmark contribution to the national agricultural transformation journey.
�?� I am proud to stand here as we witness the official birth of the Sovereign AgroTrade System (SAS), a digital ecosystem created by NWAPDI to transform agriculture from subsistence to significance.
�?� The SAS system including tools like AgriXchange Marketplace, NWAPDI Grow, AgriCert, and FarmAssure is an embodiment of what agricultural innovation should look like in the 21st century.
�?� Through this ecosystem, we are equipping smallholder farmers with the tools to thrive not just to survive in a modern, technology-driven marketplace.
�?� Today, we are not just unveiling a platform. We are launching a movement. A movement designed by Nigerians, for Nigerians particularly our women and youth,�?� he said.
He said that for too long, Nigerian rural farmers, especially women and youth have remained at the mercy of middlemen.
According to him,?� they were disconnected from global markets and deprived of the financial systems that could help scale-up their productivity adding that SAS changed that narrative.
�?� Through NWAPDI Grow, farmers can now access microloans, cooperative financing, savings platforms, and mobile payments directly from their phones. This is financial inclusion redefined-bringing banking to the bush, and banking on our people�??s success,�?� he said.
The minister commended NWAPDI and its leadership and team for the initiative, bold vision and tenacity.
�?� You are not only solving problems, but you are also setting a new national standards essence of the Renewed Hope Agenda of empowering people, building inclusive prosperity, and restoring dignity through hard work, innovation, and purpose.
�?� The Federal Government is committed to creating an enabling environment for this system to thrive, scaling its impact, and integrating its data and insights into our broader national agricultural strategy,�?� he said.
Earlier, NWAPDI�??s National Coordinator, Omolara Svensson, said the initiative aimed to move farmers from subsistence to prosperity.
SAS is not just technology but a promise?� that our farmers will no longer be at the mercy of middlemen, volatile markets,
�?� This is how we keep our youth on the land, not because they have no other option, but because agriculture now offers dignity, opportunity, and a future worth staying for.
�?� SAS is a bridge, linking farms to markets, farmers to finance, and communities to global opportunities. It is a tool for wealth creation, food security, and national pride,�?� she said.
She urged all women farmers every young agrientrepreneur and every community leader to own the initiative.
�?�?� Use it, let it lift you from where you are to where you dream to be because when women farmers rise, nations are fed, economies are strengthened, and communities are transformed,�?� she said.
Mr Dion Croom, President, Norcom, LLC, and Lead Consortium Partner,?� said the?�AgroTrade System
was developed to empower women and youth in agriculture.
Croom said that the system also aimed to promote food security and sustainable farming practices. (NAN) (

Nigeria accounts for 70% of 11m Illegal arms in W/Africa,Ehigimetor Igbaugba,8/14/2025 18:01,Defence/Security,"Nigeria accounts for 70% of 11m Illegal arms in W/Africa

By Ehigimetor Igbaugba
Calabar, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The National Center for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) says that Nigeria is accountable for 70 per cent of 11 million illegal arms and light weapons in West Africa,
Mr Alex Ebimiebo, the South South Zonal Director of the NCCSALW, made the remark at the Naval Warfare Course 9 Inter-Agency seminar, organised by the Naval War College in Calabar on Thursday.
Ebimiebo presented a paper themed, �??Strengthening Security Agencies Collaboration to Counter Illicit Arms Proliferation for Enhanced National Security in Nigeria.�?�
He said that the illegal arms dealings were largely responsible for Nigeria�??s 2.2 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and 26,000 refugees in neighboring countries.
Ebimiebo further said that arms proliferation had led to economic distortions, an increase in violence, crime, and impediment to peace building.
He, however, called for concerted effort from all Nigerians to tackle the menace, saying that NCCSALW would take the fight to the society since security is the responsibility of everyone.
�??So, as a result, everybody is a stakeholder, so as such, we need to involve the whole society in this fight and the center has a lot of programmes for collaboration with our sister agencies.
�?�We also have advocacy and sensitisation programmes that we take to members of the general public from time to time,�?� he said.
Meanwhile, Rear Adm. Akinola Oludude, Commandant, Naval War College, expressed concern on the influx of illicit arms into Nigeria since 2020.
He attributed this to the extensive borderline of about 4,470 kilometers between Nigeria, the Republic of Benin, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon.
He also noted that the nation�??s maritime domain that extended over 853 kilometers of coastline and of the Gulf of Guinea had also not helped.
The commandant said that the 2021 survey by the NCCSALW revealed that over six million illegal weapons were in circulation in the country.
Oludude said that out of the figure, about 70 per cent were in the hands of non-states actors.
�?�The impact of this illicit arms proliferation is profound and multifaceted.
�?�These weapons bred various forms of insecurity, including terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, communal clashes, and armed robbery.
�??Inter-agency collaboration is needed to tackle the proliferation of illicit arms and weapons,�?� he said.
Oludude said that no single agency, no matter how well-resourced, no matter how well-dedicated, could effectively tackle the complex challenge alone.
He stated that the nature of the recent arms proliferation demanded a joint and multi-agency approach.
�??Therefore, this seminar provides a vital platform for us to collectively examine the complexities of this complex challenge,�?� he said.
Also speaking, the Flag Officer Commanding (FOC), Eastern Naval Command, Rear Adm. Kennedy Ezete, urged the participants to translate the discussions and recommendations of the seminar into concrete actions.
He advised the participants to take the knowledge and insights gained to their respective agencies and organisations and implement them
According to him, �??we must ensure that the suggestions and way forward developed here are implemented effectively and that the partnerships forged are sustained.
�?�This requires a commitment from all stakeholders, including the leadership of our security agencies and the wider community.
�?�Share your experiences, implement the strategies that have been suggested, and continue to work collaboratively to counter illicit arms proliferation.
�??We must also continue to invest in training, technology, and intelligence gathering to enhance our capabilities.�?� (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

Support
By Emmanuel Antswen
Makurdi, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) Idoma women under the auspices of Anya�?? Ole K�??Idoma Women in Politics have drummed up support for Mrs Lami Ogenyi, Deputy Speaker, Benue House of Assembly.
Speaking to newsmen on Thursday in Makurdi, Mrs Julie Abah and Mrs Onma Ogenyi, spokespersons for the group, urged all constituents and well-wishers to support the deputy speaker to succeed.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that there was an ongoing political power tussle between the deputy speaker and Mr Sunday Oche, Chairman, Ado Local Government Area.
The group strongly condemned the ongoing political crises and urged both parties to embrace peace and address the security challenges bedevilling the area.
They further regretted that the crisis was already affecting the entire Idoma nation.
Mrs Abah said as daughters of Idoma land, they were pleading that the girl-child should be allowed to breathe, adding that the impasse was capable of distracting the deputy speaker from her development efforts.
Abah said that the deputy speaker, who was among the two female lawmakers out of the 32 members in the assembly, needed the support of all women of good will.
According to her, she is also the second woman to occupy the position of deputy speaker in Northern Nigeria since independence.
�??Mrs Ogenyi has a track record of development. In two years, she has not done badly. We believe that if this crisis is resolved, she will attract and embark on more developments for our people.
�??Enough of the rancour so that she can focus on her role as deputy speaker,�?� she said.
Also, Mrs Onma Ogenyi, former Chairman of Ado LGA, appealed for a truce so that the deputy speaker could offer effective representation to Idoma land.
�??I want to appeal to both parties to give peace a chance. Usually when there is any rancour, it is the women, children and youth that are most affected. We are calling for absolute peace.
�??The woman who represent us as deputy speaker has shown capacity. She has brought women out of their shells.
�??Only recently, she carried out a medical outreach and saved a lot of lives amongst several other developmental projects like schools construction which she embarked upon in her constituency.
�??Before now, we have had a deputy speaker and representatives but what she is doing for Zone C and the entire Benue is unprecedented.
�??The reality on ground is what we are talking about and the government of Governor Alia believes in teamwork.
�??A report came to her from Ezza and as a mother, she brought it before the house in a motion and I don�??t think she committed any crime because they are her constituents.
�??She wants justice to prevail. So, what we are asking for is peace. The Deputy Speaker and chairman are our children. Let her not be distracted from her good intentions,�?� she said. (NAN)

Plateau lawmaker kicks against relocation of ITF headquarters,Blessing Odega,8/14/2025 17:29,General News,"Plateau lawmaker kicks against relocation of ITF headquarters
Relocation
Jos, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) Plateau lawmaker Prof. Theodore Maiyaki (APC/Quaan-Pan South)?�has raised alarm over the plan to relocate the Industrial Training Fund (ITF) Headquarters out of Jos.
Maiyaki raised the alarm on a matter of urgent public importance?�during the assembly�??s?�plenary on Thursday?�in Jos.
He?�urged both the Plateau and federal governments to take immediate steps to halt the plan.
Maiyaki, who also chairs the House Committee on Education, Science and Technology, said that such a move would have devastating economic and social consequences for the state.
The lawmaker?�outlined several areas of concern, noting that the relocation would strip Plateau?�of a major federal presence, weaken economic activities connected to the institution, cause job losses, erode the historical identity of the ITF in Jos, and disrupt long-standing training programmes and partnerships.
�??The ITF is not just another federal agency; it is a legacy institution in Plateau. Its continued presence in Jos is a matter of fairness, equity, and recognition of our contribution to national development,�?� he said.
He urged the?�house to pass a resolution urging the state government to urgently liaise with the Federal Government to keep the ITF headquarters in Jos.
Mayaki urged the house?�to mandate relevant committees to engage with the ITF leadership, the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, and other stakeholders to safeguard the institution�??s future in the state.
He further called on the house to communicate this resolution to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the National Assembly, and the ITF Governing Council.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the?�Industrial Training Fund, which was?�established in 1971, has been headquartered in Jos for over five decades, serving as a hub for manpower development and technical training across Nigeria. (NAN) (http://www.nannews.ng)

"PenCom, Police partner to reform officers�?? pensions",Nana Musa,8/14/2025 17:25,Economy,"Pension
By Nana Hauwa Musa
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The National Pension Commission (PenCom) and the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) are partnering to boost police officers�?? pensions and welfare under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS).
This is contained in a statement issued by PenCom management on Thursday in Abuja.
The Director-General of PenCom, Omolola Oloworaran, visited the Inspector-General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, to discuss ways of improving police officers�?? welfare.
Oloworaran stressed the need for stronger collaboration between PenCom and the police to address pension concerns and enhance officers�?? retirement benefits.
She explained that the CPS was introduced to correct flaws in the old Defined Benefits Scheme (DBS), which was unfunded, opaque, and left many retirees in hardship.
The DG acknowledged existing challenges but said PenCom was working on solutions achievable within the CPS framework.
Proposed reforms include a Health Insurance Scheme for retirees, raising pensions to 75 per cent of final salary, expanding the Retirement Resettlement Fund, and restructuring police pensions.
Oloworaran insisted there was no need for the police to exit the CPS, describing such a move as unnecessary and counterproductive.
She urged patience and continued dialogue as PenCom and the NPF implement the reforms.
She also called on the Federal Government to raise its pension contribution for police officers from 10 to 20 per cent, boosting retirement savings.
She revealed that PenCom, with the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, is working on a new Gratuity Scheme set to begin in 2026.
The scheme would grant treasury-funded federal workers one year�??s total emoluments as a gratuity at retirement.
She pledged continued reforms to ensure police officers retire with dignity and financial stability.
Oloworaran commended the NPF for its tireless service to the nation.
On his part, Egbetokun reiterated his commitment to constructive engagement to maintain public confidence in the force.
He praised PenCom�??s efforts and confirmed the police force�??s readiness to collaborate in resolving pension issues. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)

Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Director-General of the World Trade Organization, (WTO,), says President Bola Tinubu deserves credit for stabilising Nigeria�??s economy through bold reforms.
She spoke with State House correspondents on Thursday after a closed-door meeting with the President at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
Okonjo-Iweala noted the government�??s efforts to steady the economy as a key step in building long-term growth.
�??�?�The president and his team have worked hard to stabilize the economy and you can�??t really improve an economy unless it�??s stable.
�??�??He has to be given the credit for the stability of the economy, so the reforms have been in the right direction,�?�
She emphasised that stabilising the economy is only the beginning of a broader recovery agenda.
The WTO boss however stressed that more work is needed to stimulate inclusive growth and alleviate poverty in the country.
�??What is needed next is growth. We now need to grow the economy and we need to put in social safety nets so that the people who are feeling the pinch of the reforms can also have some support to be able to weather the hardship.
�??That�??s the next step, how do we build social safety nets to help Nigerians cushion the hardship they are feeling and how do we grow the economy so we can create more jobs and put money in people�??s pockets? These are issues we discussed with the President.�?�
She stressed the need for policies that directly impact the lives of Nigerians and create economic opportunities.
�??Okonjo-Iweala assured of the WTO�??s continued support for Nigeria�??s economic revival.
The meeting signals continued collaboration between the Tinubu-led government and international partners to drive economic recovery.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the World Bank acknowledges that Nigeria�??s economy is stabilising under President Tinubu�??s administration, with projected growth of 3.6 per cent in 2025.
This positive outlook is attributed to macroeconomic reforms, particularly in the petroleum, foreign exchange, and power sectors, which are creating a more stable business environment.
While inflation remains a challenge, the World Bank noted that the reforms were yielding positive results, including a significant increase in national revenue and a reduction in the fiscal deficit. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

He noted that PDP operated in a dynamic and sometimes turbulent political terrain which always demanded the very best from the party.
He recalled that in the recent times, PDP faced leadership changes and the defection of some of its members, yet the party remained a central force in Nigeria�??s democratic journey.
�??That is why the next National Working Committee (NWC) must not only be representative, it should be visionary, courageous, and proactive.
�??We need leaders of integrity, creativity, and capacity. We must place individuals who inspire confidence, mobilise effectively, and speak to the hopes of Nigerians.
�??Our zoning process must reflect fairness, equity, and strategic thinking, as well as strengthen our unity, reward loyalty, and position us for electoral victory.
�??I trust that the zoning committee will approach its task with wisdom, foresight, and a full understanding of the bigger picture: PDP over anyone, and PDP above any personal interest,�?� he said.
Damagum advised the committee to make decisions that would reignite hope and inspire confidence in people saying that politics demanded pragmatism, not sentiments.
�??Loyalty is the lifeblood of our party. Without it, unity is impossible. Yet loyalty alone is not enough, it must walk hand in hand with competence.
�??As you consider zoning, picture the calibre of individuals who may emerge from each zone. Ask yourselves, will this person embody the values and strength of the PDP in a way that makes us proud before the nation?�?� he asked.
Damagum also charged the committee to note that the deputies positions were as important as the principals, citing how he emerged as the acting national chairman from deputy national chairman (North).
He said though the process was dramatic, he was able to rise to the challenge and stand firm in the storm because he was prepared and understood the weight of service.
The National Organising Secretary of PDP, Umar Bature, said that the committee was very important as it would lay the foundation for the future of PDP in coming years and the catalyst that would bring life back to the party.
Bature expressed confidence that the committee would do justice with the responsibility assigned to it and submit its report in the next two weeks.
The Senate Minority Leader, Sen. Abba Morro, urging the committee to get it right, said that the lessons and consequences from the last zoning arrangement for the 2023 general election circle was still fresh within the party.
�??The disastrous consequences of what was conceived to be right decision. The expectation of all of us here, especially from the National Assembly, is that this time we must get it right. We can no longer experiment,�?� he said.
Speaking on behalf of the PDP Board of Trustees, former Minister of Women Affairs, Chief Inna Shiroma, expressed the board�??s support for any decision taken to move the party forward.
She, however, advised the committee to be careful and to do the right thing, saying Nigerians need PDP to rescue the country.
The Chairman of PDP Governors�?? Forum, ?�Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, promised the committee of the forum�??s support.
�??I assure you, the governors are behind this project of making Nigeria one and unified and bringing a leadership recruitment that will make Nigeria happy, irrespective of their personal interests,�??�?? he said.
He expressed confidence that the committee would do its best in providing the best leadership to lead PDP into victory in 2027.
In his acceptance speech, the Chairman of the Committee and Governor of Bayelsa, Duoye Diri, described the assignment as huge, pledging the committee�??s resolve to do its best.
�??We will be consultative, we will partner, and we will be inclusive in ensuring that we arrive at a fair and just zoning formula for our party,�?� Diri said.
Also at the meeting were governors of Oyo, Seyi Makinde, Caleb Muftwang ?�of Plateau, members of the PDP National Working Committee and some BoT members.(NAN)(

LCCI urges new members to uphold ethics,Rukayat Moisemhe,8/14/2025 16:45,Economy,"Induction
By Rukayat Moisemhe
Lagos, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has urged new members to uphold ethics, embrace innovation, and leverage its platform for sustainable growth and global competitiveness.
LCCI President, Mr Gabriel Idahosa, made the call on Thursday in Lagos during the formal induction of 38 new organisations into the chamber.
He noted that LCCI had remained the leading private sector voice through sustained public policy advocacy, stakeholder engagement, and trade promotion activities.
Idahosa said the chamber had consistently promoted and protected private enterprise, commerce, and industry to foster global competitiveness.
He added that, in 2020, LCCI obtained the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) 9001:2015 certificate.
�??This makes us the first chamber of commerce in West Africa to be ISO certified, and the second in Africa �?? a milestone we relish with pride.
�??As we induct your companies today, I emphasise our commitment to high ethical standards, innovation, continuous improvement, integrity, and good corporate governance in business practice.
�??As business owners and managers, your primary aim is profit, but I charge you to prioritise transaction integrity, environmental care, climate action, and social sustainability.
�??I enjoin you all to commit to high ethical standards, global best practices, and responsible corporate citizenship.
�??Indeed, the chamber has a code of business ethics for all members,�?� he said.
Idahosa added that the LCCI had strengthened its services to meet stakeholder needs.
This, he said, would catalyse private enterprises and organisations to achieve sustainable growth and global competitiveness. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)

"NCoS reports giving non-custodial sentences to over 64,000 inmates in 5 years",Ibironke Ariyo,8/14/2025 16:42,Defence/Security,"Personnel of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) during the Third public hearing on Thursday in
Inmates
By Ibironke Ariyo
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025(NAN) The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) says no fewer than 64,000 inmates received non-custodial sentences between 2021 and 2025.
The Controller of Corrections in charge of Probation, Ponyaka Nandang, disclosed this on Thursday in Abuja during the third public hearing of the Independent Investigative Panel on Alleged Corruption and Other Violations against the correctional service.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that non-custodial sentences�??alternatives to imprisonment�??include community service, suspended sentences, fines, probation, and restitution orders.
According to NAN, these measures aim to rehabilitate offenders and reduce prison overcrowding by providing punishments that do not involve incarceration.
Speaking before the panel on Thursday in Abuja, Nandang revealed that between 2021 and 2024, a total of 54,523 inmates, comprised of 49,463 men and 5,060 women, were placed under non-custodial measures nationwide.
Nandang added that another 10,406 inmates�??comprising 9,207 men and 1,199 women�??received similar sentences between January and June 2025.
He, however, noted that in spite of the growing use of these alternatives to incarceration, challenges, such as?� inadequate funding, limited staffing, and weak judicial collaboration had persisted.
He warned that without stronger institutional support, the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of the non-custodial measures established under the NCoS Act of 2019 remained uncertain.
�??We have some impediments, and it�??s very obvious. One of the major impediments is funds. No budgetary allocations deliberately meant for restorative justice,�?� he lamented.
He also decried the lack of infrastructure and basic logistics to support operations in many areas.
�??Sometimes, you have to appeal to a local government chairman for office space; even when it is granted, there are no seats or basic facilities to carry out the required duties.
�??The human resource deficit is equally a challenge. The total number of officers managing non-custodial services across the country is just 1,563.
�??The state with the highest number is Kebbi, with 131 staff, while Imo has the fewest, with only seven officers,�?� he added.
The NCoS Controller also cited weak judicial participation in the implementation of non-custodial measures, especially regarding probation and parole.
According to him, most courts have not been granting probation orders, either because the substantive laws have not adequately captured them or due to other legal gaps.
�??While parole boards have been established across several states, delays persist due to the absence of necessary technical committees at the national level.
�??We are yet to form the technical committees whose members are to sit on these recommendations and then eventually grant parolees those prospective parolees,�?� the controller maintained.
Nandang, however, expressed concern that restorative justice was being hampered by rigid legal interpretations, in spite of its potential.
He said, �??Even for inmates on death row, can we also kick-start the process of restorative justice?
Not necessarily with the view that these people should be removed from custodial centres, but that relationships should be restored.�?�
He called for collaboration with traditional institutions, vigilante groups, and non-state actors, whom he said had already been instrumental in bridging implementation gaps in some areas.
He also called on the judiciary and prosecuting agencies to align with the correctional service�??s efforts, warning that outdated legal provisions were hindering progress.
�??Because of inadequate staffing, we have sometimes had to rely on vigilante groups to execute some of the court sentences,�?� he said.
�??Also, most judiciary officers will tell you that you do not have enough provisions to back up this implementation of non-custodial services,�?�he said.
Nandang, however, remained hopeful that with stronger political will, legal reforms, and stakeholder�??s cooperation, the non-custodial system could play a transformative role in Nigeria�??s justice sector.
�??Non-custodial measures are helping the NCoS, but there are still many challenges. If we truly want this to work, we need the support of every stakeholder,�?� he emphasised.(NAN) (www.nannews.ng)

Lagos engages stakeholders on pilot PPP for water corporation,Fabian Ekeruche,8/14/2025 16:39,Environment,"PPP
By Fabian Ekeruche and Olaitan Idris
Lagos, Aug. 14,
2025
, (NAN) The Lagos State Government has convened a stakeholders�?? engagement on a pilot Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative for the Lagos Water Corporation (LWC), to explore innovative and technology-driven approach to improving water service delivery.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the meeting with the theme, �??Attracting Investment for Improved Water Supply in Lagos State through Public-Private Partnership,�?� was held on Thursday in Lagos.
The two-day event was organised by the LWC with the support of WaterAid, Nigeria.
Speaking at the event, the Special Adviser, Ministry for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Rotimi Akodu, described the initiative as a critical step in addressing the state�??s growing water demand, driven by rapid urbanisation and population growth.
Akodu said the initiative reflected the state�??s recognition that achieving universal access to potable water required both substantial capital investment and operational efficiency-elements that could be enhanced through strategic PPP.
The Permanent Secretary, Office of Drainage Services and Water Resources, Mr Mahamood Adegbite,?�noted that the state had made commendable progress in expanding water infrastructure.
Adegbite, however, said the scale of current challenges, from aging facilities to the impact of climate change, demands innovative partnerships that prioritise sustainability, resilience, and accountability.
According to him, the government�??s vision is clear �?? to guarantee uninterrupted access to clean and safe water for all Lagosians.
He added that the partnership model would ensure enhanced?� infrastructure to serve future generations.
�??We urge stakeholders to support and embrace this new structure for the greater good of our citizens,�?� Adegbite said.
Also, the Permanent Secretary, Office of Environmntal Services, Dr Omobolaji Gaji, said that shortage in funding and reduction in foreign supports had made it compelling for the governments to be innovative in funding the water sector.
�??Therefore, there is no better time to partner with the private sector to bring in funding and to improve water services than now,�?� Gaji said.
Speaking at the event, the Managing Director of Lagos Water Corporation, Mr Mukhtaar Tijani, reiterated the government�??s vision to transform the water sector into a modern, efficient, and sustainable system.
Tijani said the government envisioned a system capable of meeting the current and future needs of residents, supporting economic growth, and aligning with global best practices in water resource management.
He noted that the PPP framework offered a unique opportunity to combine public oversight with private sector innovation, operational efficiency, and investment capacity, to boost production, reduce water losses, and ensure efficient distribution to underserved communities.
According to him,?� the PPP initiative is not an attempt to privatise water resources, but rather a strategic collaboration to improve service quality, expand coverage, and ensure the financial viability of operations.
�??The decision to pilot the model through selected mini and micro waterworks is guided by the need to leverage private sector expertise, innovation, and funding,�?� he said.
Reeling out the overview of the Pilot Public-Private Partnership for the LWC, Tijani described the initiative as a crucial step in the state�??s broader strategy to modernise public utilities, safeguard public health, and stimulate economic growth.
He assured the state�??s committed to transparent procurement processes and robust regulatory oversight to safeguard public interest and foster a commercially attractive investment climate.
He commended WaterAid Nigeria for its commitment to supporting the Lagos Water Corporation to improve urban water supply in Lagos State.
In her remarks, the Country Director of WaterAid Nigeria, Evelyn Mere, called on the government to scale up the Akilo water scheme management model that is aimed at achieving sustainable urban water supply.
Mere said that?� PPP remained a feasible panacea to improve urban water supply in Lagos to ensure residents have access to affordable and quality potable water.
She commended Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu for assenting to the WASH policy in February
2024
.
She dsclosed that?�Akilo waterworks, which is being rehabilitated by WaterAid Nigeria, would be inaugurated in September.
The country director charged?� the state government to use Akilo as a model to resuscitate others.
NAN reports that stakeholders at the meeting lauded the state government�??s strategic drive to provide essential water resources and its openness in involving communities and private partners in decision-making. (NAN)(

Awka, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Commissioner for Information in Anambra, Dr Law Mefor, has said that the ruling-All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) will win the two contested positions in the Aug. 16 by-elections in the state.
Mefor expressed the optimism, while speaking on his expectations ahead of the poll in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Awka on Thursday.
According to him, APGA candidates, including Dr Emma Nwachukwu (Anambra South Senatorial District) and Ms Mimi Azikiwe, the granddaughter of Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe (Onitsha 1 State Constituency), are not only popular but had pedigree.
He also said that APGA had done well over the years, and the people of Anambra South Senatorial District and Onitsha 1 State Constituency were going to reward Gov. Chukwuma Soludo for doing a good job.
�??Already, the people of Anambra have endorsed Soludo, the Central, North and South Senatorial Districts have held endorsement rallies for him, South in particularly raised over N100 million for his re-election.
�??For Onitsha, the town has benefitted, perhaps more than other parts of Anambra, with the transformation of the city, like Fegge and Ochanja as well as its suburbs, like Okpoko and others.
�??Our candidates are more qualified than their opponents in other parties and Anambra is essentially an APGA state.
�??All these will play out on Saturday.
�??There is no way our candidates will not win the by-election, they will win convincingly,�?� he said.
Mefor urged the people to participate freely in the election, saying that �??the state is safe and secure�?�. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

Lagos issues traffic advisory for bridge repairs,Chiazo Ogbolu,8/14/2025 16:34,"General News, Metro","Repairs
By Chiazo Ogbolu
Lagos, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Lagos State Government (LASG) has issued a traffic advisory ahead of emergency repairs on the damaged section of the Maryland Independence Bridge wall.
The Commissioner for Transportation, Mr Oluwaseun Osiyemi, announced this in a statement issued to newsmen on Thursday in Lagos.
Osiyemi stated that the repairs will run from Saturday, Aug. 16, to Tuesday, Aug. 19, between 11.00 p.m. and 4.00 a.m. daily.
Consequently, motorists are advised to use alternative routes during the three-night repair works to avoid delays.
Motorists bound for Oshodi, Ojuelegba, Stadium and Lagos will be diverted at Maria Lodge, Maryland, onto the Maryland Bridge to connect Idiroko inward Anthony.
This diversion is necessary because the main carriageway will remain closed to vehicular movement throughout the repair period.
However, motorists travelling inbound Ketu or Ikorodu from Lagos, Stadium or Anthony will experience unhindered movement during the works.
Osiyemi assured that traffic management personnel will be deployed to minimise inconvenience and control vehicular flow during the repairs.
He urged motorists to follow officers�?? directives to ensure smooth traffic flow and avoid unnecessary congestion.
Motorists are implored to remain patient throughout the repair period. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)

Ajaokuta
By Martha Agas
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The non functional?� Ajaokuta Steel Company Limited (ASCL) is costing the country more than N1 billion annually in pensions, salaries, taxes, and administrative costs.
Prof. Linus Asuquo, Director-General (D-G) of the National Metallurgical Development Centre, Jos, stated this in his presentation at a panel discussion at the maiden edition of the National Steel Summit on Thursday in Abuja.
The discussion was titled �??Dissecting the Current Policy Framework: Identifying Gaps and Building a Robust Institutional Regulation�?�.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that, according to a 2024 report by BudgIT�??s accountability platform,?� Ajaokuta�??s financial burden has continued to grow, with about �??1.11 billion spent in the past two years.
The D-G listed the challenges of the steel company to include a huge financial burden, mismanagement, corruption, and a disconnected value chain infrastructure.
According to him, Nigeria has invested over eight billion U.S. dollars in the Ajaokuta project over a period of more than 40 years.
He said that persistent mismanagement and policy failures derailed the project, as funds were misappropriated and concessionaire deals failed, citing the Japanese Kob Steel and India-based Global Steel Holdings Limited (GSHL) as examples.
Asuquo explained that the ASCL was burdened with a disconnected value chain infrastructure, as the iron ore mines at the National Iron Ore Mining Company (NIOMCO) in Itakpe, Kogi, remained non-operational.
�??Rail line for transporting ore from Itakpe to Ajaokuta was delayed, vandalised, it was only completed and inaugurated in 2020.
�??Obsolete technology and degraded equipment because most of the installed machinery has degraded over decades and the plant lacks modern energy efficient steel making technologies.�?�
He also noted that local community displacement remains unresolved as 13 villages were displaced when the plant was built.
According to Prof. Asuquo, the way forward is to rebuild the integrated supply chain and adopt modern mini-mill technologies.
He recommended shifting from large-scale blast furnaces to compact strip production (CSP), a cheaper, more energy-efficient technology that can be built and made operational more quickly.
Other recommendations he made included adopting private sector concessions, which entailed a complete shift from government management to strategic private investors with proven expertise.
�??The way forward includes-manufacturing and pulsed revival of the plant, community and civil society engagement through (ESIA) Environmental and Social Impact Assessment.
�??It (ASCL) can be used as an industrial park and free trade zone,�?? he said.
He noted that Nigeria�??s key legacy steel assets were mostly underutilised and equipped with obsolete machinery, stating that revitalising them required policy and institutional reforms alongside strategic public-private partnerships.
The D-G listed other measures to include infrastructure and energy improvements; research, development and innovation; human capital development; raw materials exploration and processing; and sustainable financing mechanisms.
�??Revitalising Nigeria�??s legacy steel assets is a national imperative. With political will, coherent policies, private sector collaboration, and sustained investment, the steel sector can become a key driver of industrialisation and economic transformation,�?? he said.
The theme of the summit is?� Rebuilding and Consolidating Nigeria�??s Steel Industry: Collaborative Action for Sustainable Growth and Global Competitiveness.(NAN)(

FCTA receives 4 CNG hybrid buses to boost public transport,Philip Daniel Yatai,8/14/2025 16:29,Metro,"CNG
By Philip Yatai
Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has received four 50-seater hybrid Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) buses from the Presidential CNG Initiative (PCNGI) to improve public transportation in the territory.
While receiving the keys in Abuja on Thursday, FCT Minister Nyesom Wike, represented by the Mandate Secretary, FCT Transportation Secretariat, Mr Chinedum Elechi, said the buses would comfortably transport up to 200 people.
He noted that the buses would run on both CNG and Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), in line with President Bola Tinubu�??s
Renewed Hope Agenda
.
According to Wike, no modern city will thrive without a robust public transportation system.
�??So, public transportation is meant to move people from one point to the other, especially those who cannot afford private transportation, or those who can afford private transportation but opt to go on the public system.
�??Also, when tourists come in, they don�??t come with their private transportation; they depend on a robust public transportation system.
�??This is why we are building roads, bridges and bus terminals. We have just commissioned two of the modern bus terminals at Mabushi and Kugbo, while the third one in the Central Area will soon be ready,�?� he said.
The minister said that the FCTA would procure more buses to ease public transportation in the nation�??s capital.
He commended Tinubu for the initiative and for ensuring that the FCTA was not left out.
Mr Michael Oluwagbemi, Programme Director and Chief Executive, PCNGI, while?� handing over the keys to the minister, said that the initiative would make sure that the CNG buses get to the identified beneficiaries across the country.
Oluwagbemi explained that the presidential initiative was designed to ensure that Nigerians move around in a cheaper, safer and more reliable transaction system.
He commended the FCTA for demonstrating a great support for the PCNGI programme.
He added that the Administration has shown great innovation by investing not just in roads infrastructure but in Bus Terminals under the great leadership of the minister.
�??You are receiving four because you are one of our biggest supporters and also because through you, we know more people because you are in the business of direct transportation at the FCT.
�??We see your terminals; we see your roads. So we want to thank you.
�??For this we felt that the FCTA should be a major beneficiary of this initiative and I want to thank everybody at the FCTA for the good job you are doing.
�??I look forward to an FCT in the next two to three years where residents will leave their vehicles at home and take one of these buses to work, town and other places, as is done in other developed countries,�?� he said. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

Abuja, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Reduction, Prof. Nentawe Yilwatda, has called for a transition from short-term relief efforts to long-term, sustainable strategies in addressing humanitarian needs across Nigeria.
Yilwatda made the call while delivering a keynote address at the Nigeria INGO Forum (NIF) Dialogue Series on Thursday in Abuja.
The address was delivered on his behalf by Mrs Ene Odusuyi, Technical Adviser on Policy Review and Intergovernance Relations.
The event was themed
�??Accountability in Action: Advancing Durable Solutions for Crisis-Affected Populations Amid Dwindling Aid.�?�
He stressed that the growing scale of humanitarian needs continued to outpace the resources available, both globally and nationally.
�??In spite of increasing humanitarian needs, global donor aid is shrinking.
�??This reality is actively felt in Nigeria, as the country has been listed as an �??accelerated transition country�?? by the United Nations.
�??This means the traditional international humanitarian architecture will soon be dismantled.�?�
He highlighted the protracted conflict in the Northeast, which had displaced 2.3 million people, and growing crises in the Northwest and North Central regions, driven by criminal banditry and widespread violence.
�??The 2025 Humanitarian Response Plan projects that 910 billion dollar is needed to support 3.6 million people in Borno, Yobe, and other affected states.
�??Behind these statistics are real people, families displaced, communities striving to rebuild amid great loss,�?� he said.
Yilwatda reassured stakeholders of the government�??s commitment to working with partners to ensure that no one was left behind.
Speaking at the event, Mr Trond Jensen, Head of Office, UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Nigeria, underscored the need for inclusivity and empowerment in humanitarian response.
�??When it comes to accountability, inclusivity is key.
�??We must prioritise the most vulnerable, often women and girls, and ensure they are given power and choices.
�??They need what they actually want, not what we assume they need,�?� Jensen said.
He emphasised the importance of collaboration between humanitarian and development actors to reduce long-term dependence on foreign assistance.
�??As humanitarians, our role is to complement government efforts and work with local partners and civil society.
�??We must build trust and enable communities to eventually take over operations,�?� he said.
Mrs Chimda Musa, Executive Director of the Rural Agricultural Transformation and Empowerment Initiative (RATEI), emphasised a practical model that integrated displaced women into agriculture, particularly rice farming.
�??These women are not only learning to cultivate rice but also engaging in rice processing and organic fertiliser production.
�??This social enterprise creates sustainability and can be replicated in other regions,�?� she explained.
Also speaking, Hauwa Nuhu, Managing Editor of
Human Angle Magazine
, emphasised the critical role of the media in exposing humanitarian issues and tracking accountability gaps.
�??Accountability is essential to identify gaps and drive real, sustainable solutions for affected regions,�?� she said.
Director of the NIF, Ms. Camilla Higgins, pointed out that accountability extended beyond financial management.
�??We can�??t talk about accountability without mentioning the devastating funding cuts this year.
�??The loss of U.S. funding has been particularly severe, but we�??re seeing donors across the board shift priorities.
�??In Nigeria alone, more than 2.3 million people are internally displaced in the Northeast, and 4.6 million face food insecurity nationwide.
�??Our response must be smarter, more accountable, and more sustainable,�?� she said.
Higgins stressed the need to amplify community voices and keep affected people at the centre of humanitarian responses.
The forum convened a diverse group of stakeholders from government, international and national NGOs, UN agencies, civil society, and the media to explore durable solutions and improve accountability in Nigeria�??s humanitarian efforts. (NAN)(

�??I am pleased to report significant breakthroughs achieved by our dedicated officers and operatives through intelligence driven operations over the past three weeks.
�??These efforts led to a total of 76 interceptions of smuggled and contraband goods, which include the following: 4,068 bags of foreign parboiled rice (50kg each).
�??This is equivalent to seven trailer loads, 22 used (tokunbo) vehicles, including two Ashok Leyland drilling trucks.

Shu�??aibu further stated that 13 suspects arrested had been granted administrative bail, while others were handed over to relevant security agencies for further investigation and possible prosecution.
He mentioned that their commitment to inter-agency collaboration, led to the seized cannabis sativa which would be handed over to the appropriate authorities for further investigation and prosecution.
The FOU boss said that the command also maintained vigilance against smuggling and fraud adding that the unit would remain a strong partner in trade facilitation.
Shu�??aibu said that the unit would continue to support legitimate trade through intelligence-driven operations that struck a balance between security enforcement and economic growth.
He commended the support of the Comptroller-General of Customs, Bashir Adeniyi, reaffirming their steadfastness to securing the nation�??s borders against all forms of economic sabotage.
Shu�??aibu however, emphasized that the command would not relent in its mission to uphold the integrity of Nigeria�??s trade environment and protect the economy from illicit trade practices.
Also speaking, the NDLEA Deputy Commander, Nasir Bungudu, said the seizure would go a long way in protecting the economy.

Gov Mbah hails Tinubu�??s bold initiatives to transform Nigeria,alex enebeli,8/14/2025 16:01,General News,"Transformation
By Alex Enebeli
Enugu, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) Gov. Peter Mbah of Enugu State has hailed President Bola Tinubu�??s bold and tough initiatives aimed at transforming Nigeria.
He equally extolled Tinubu�??s commitment to fostering citizens�?? engagement, disclosing that immediately after swearing in, he signed the Executive Order 001 to effectively engage the people and quarterly render accounts to them.
The governor made the commendation when the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Mohammed Idris paid a courtesy visit to Mbah at the Enugu Government House, on Thursday.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Idris was accompanied by the Directors-Generals, Managing Directors under the ministry and others on the visit.
Mbah noted that prior to Tinubu�??s administration, the state struggled ?�to pay salaries after receiving federal allocations before it ever contemplated to embark on capital projects.
�??But today, that is not the case; we are not only talking about payment of salaries but talking about executing humongous projects.
�??Thanks to this bold initiative and very tough decisions taken by the president; but again, development comes sometimes with this temporary discomfort but the truth is that the outcome has a lot of benefits,�?� he said.
He added that aside the removal of fuel subsidies, the removal of the arbitrage in the exchange rates by Tinubu had brought the exchange rate regime together.
Mbah said that his administration was building about 7, 000 brand new classrooms and equipping them, explaining that the Smart Green Schools each featured all the 21st century skills.
The governor said the school had a robotic and artificial intelligence centres as well as computer generated image studios where the state teach young people with virtual and augmented reality.
He added that the state was building 260 type two primary healthcare centres across the 260 wards with staff quarters with 25KVA solar system to ensure that rural dwellers have 24/ 7 access to healthcare.
�??This is something that we also have in common with the Federal Government, making sure that we are committed to governance at the grassroots�?�.
He commended Tinubu for approving the concessioning of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, which he said, would fully operationalise the international wing of the airport and make it aviation hub.
�??So we want to express our deepest gratitude for this great work
Mr President is doing here. We see a lot of similarity in what we are doing here.
�??We will continue to support the President to succeed because these projects, programmes and policies are uplifting Nigerians.
Earlier, the minister said they were in Enugu to engage with the people of the state and inspect some of the Federal Government projects in Enugu.
Those in attendance include the Special Adviser to Tinubu on Information and Strategy, Mr Bayo Onanuga, Managing Director of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Ali Mohammed Ali.
Others ?�included in the entourage were Director-Generals of the National Orientation Agency (NOA) Lanre Issa- Onilu, Voice of Nigeria (VON), Mallam Jibrin Ndace, the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA), Salihu Abdulhamid and Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), Dr Muhammad Bulama.

Stakeholders urge FG to revitalise MSMEs for sustainable economy,Yetunde Fatungase,8/14/2025 16:01,Economy,"Economy
By Yetunde Fatungase
Abeokuta, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN)?�The Federal Government (FG) has been urged to implement targeted policies to revitalise the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector to achieve a sustainable economy.
Stakeholders in the sector made the call in Abeokuta on Thursday during the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Fair, themed �??Driving Alternative Payment Channels as Tools for Economic Development�?�.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that some of the stakeholders at the fair include microfinance institutions, FinTechs, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), regulators, and academia.
In their separate messages, they expressed concern that the Naira redesign policy has had a detrimental impact on SMEs, resulting in economic struggles in the country.
CBN acting Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mrs Harkama Sidi-Ali, however, said the bank has launched a series of initiatives to boost the economy and protect consumers in the financial sector.
She described the fair as an interactive platform for members of the public and critical stakeholders to discuss CBN�??s policies for sustainable economic growth and national development.
Sidi-Ali says the fair�??s theme is apt as it addresses the importance of value addition and the links that catalyse SMEs and economic activities to attain the needed price stability.
�??The management of the bank, under the leadership of Mr Olayemi Cardoso, is committed to stimulating productivity and financial inclusiveness as well as delivering on its core mandate of monetary and price stability.
�??This has resulted in a significant increase in the inflow of foreign investments, positive trade balances and a quantum leap in the financial inclusion rate in recent times.
�??The core objective of this engagement, therefore, is to sensitise members of the public on how the bank�??s policies and innovations can enhance their lives and livelihood and contribute to the growth and development of the Nigerian economy,�?� she said.
Sidi-Ali, however, assured Nigerians of the availability of the Naira, while also cautioning against mutilating, spraying, hawking or counterfeiting the currency.
Earlier, the CBN Branch Controller in Ogun, Mr Malik Ademola, reiterated that the fair was an avenue to sensitise the public on the bank�??s policies, programmes and interventions.
He noted that the fair has evolved into a veritable channel for fostering communication between the bank and the grassroots.
He expressed the bank�??s commitment to ensuring a sound financial system and an inclusive economy where every Nigerian could thrive.
�??It enables us, not only to explain our policies, but also to listen to your concerns, feedback and expectations.
�??This year�??s event continues that tradition, and I encourage everyone here to actively participate in the discussions.
�??As we navigate the evolving economic landscape locally and globally, the need for increased public awareness of monetary policy, financial inclusion, consumer protection, digital payments, and intervention programmes cannot be overemphasised,�?� he said.
A participant and founder of Landgold Microfinance Bank, Mr Bunmi Ogunrinde, stressed the importance of MSMEs to Nigeria�??s economic survival.
According to Ogunrinde, the economy is basically driven by MSMEs; hence, the nation�??s economy can only survive where SMEs thrive.
�??Even in America, their economy is driven by MSMEs, including family businesses.
�??MSMEs are the greatest employers of labour, and that is why the government must be very intentional about driving the MSMEs.
�??At one time, financial inclusion was going steadily, but during Emefiele�??s regime and the cashless policy, many microfinance banks died. Then, we had close to 1,000 microfinance banks in Nigeria.
�??We must be intentional about the economy. Whatever policy the government is coming up with must not affect SMEs; they are the �??livewire�?? of the economy.
Ogunrinde urged the government to prioritise policies that will resuscitate the microfinance banking sector, describing it as critical to broadening financial inclusion. (NAN)(www.nannews.ng)

2027: INEC warns against premature campaigns in Nasarawa,Sunday John,8/14/2025 15:54,Politics,"2027: INEC warns against premature campaigns in Nasarawa
Campaigns
By Sunday John
Lafia, Aug. 14, 2025 (NAN) The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has warned aspirants in Nasarawa against premature campaigns ahead of the 2027 general elections.
INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Dr Shehu Wahab, gave the warning at a stakeholders�?? meeting on Thursday in Lafia, ahead of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) scheduled to begin on Monday, Aug.18.
Wahab, however, expressed concern over �??the disturbing indiscriminate abuse of campaign posters and billboards by aspirants before the official campaign period�?�.
�??This not only undermines the electoral process but also sets a precedent that can erode the standards of political conduct in the country.
�??As stakeholders, you must collectively advocate for adherence to the electoral guidelines and promote a culture of respect for the democratic process�?�, he said.
The REC said mobilising citizens for the CVR was the responsibility of the commission and frowned upon politicians sponsoring advertisements in that regard.
�??There is an aspirant who sponsored an advertisement and produced jingles, calling on the people to turn out for the CVR.
�??The worst part is that the aspirant clearly mentioned his aspiration for the 2027 election in the advertisement and jingles,�?� he said.
Wahab said that the online pre-registration of the CVR would commence on Monday, Aug. 18, 2025, while the in-person registration would start on Aug. 25.
He explained that the exercise complied with the law to ensure that every eligible citizen had their name in the voter register.
�??The idea of CVR is deliberately crafted to allow for voter mobility, correction of details and fresh registrations for those who did not do so before or those who turned 18 after the last exercise,�?� he said.
The REC further urged stakeholders to advice residents in the state against underage registration and multiple registration, adding that anyone caught would face sanctions.
He also urged the public to take advantage of the exercise instead of waiting for the end to ask for an extension of time.
Similarly, INEC Director of Operations in the state, Sale El-Mahmoud, said that the exercise would begin from 9:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. at the INEC headquarters in Lafia and in the 13 Local Government Areas in the state.
El-Mahmoud added that INEC personnel would be at the designated centers from Mondays to Fridays, excluding public holidays.
He explained that the exercise would include fresh registration, voter transfer, update of voter information, replacement of lost Permanent Voter�??s Cards and defaced or damaged cards. (NAN) (www.nannews.ng)
